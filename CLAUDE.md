This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains historical documents from Project Gutenberg - specifically, WPA Federal Writers' Project slave narratives from the 1930s. These are primary source materials consisting of interviews with formerly enslaved people conducted during the Great Depression.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains text files of slave narrative collections from various U.S. states:

- **GEORGIA NARRATIVES PART 1.txt** - Volume IV, Georgia narratives

- **Untitled document.txt** - South Carolina narratives, Part 4

## Document Structure

Each file follows the Project Gutenberg eBook format:
- Header with Project Gutenberg license and metadata
- Title, author (U.S. Work Projects Administration), and release date

## Working with These Files

These are historical primary source documents that should be:
- Treated as read-only archival material unless explicitly directed to process or analyze them
- Handled with awareness of their historical and cultural significance
- Recognized as containing period-specific language and perspectives

## File Format

- All files are plain text (.txt) format
- UTF-8 encoding with BOM (﻿) at the start
- No code, build system, or development tooling required
- No testing or linting infrastructure

## Typical Tasks

When working with this repository, common requests may include:
- Analyzing or extracting information from the narratives
- Organizing or categorizing the content
- Creating summaries or indices
- Converting formats or restructuring data
- Text processing and analysis
