Cinto Lewis




*Uncle Cinto Lewis, ex-slave, claims to be 111 years old. He lived in a
brick cabin with his wife, Aunt Lucy, on the Huntington Plantation, in
Brazoria Co., Texas. Miss Kate Huntington says the cabin occupied by the
old couple is part of the old slave quarters built by J. Greenville
McNeel, who owned the plantation before Marion Huntington. Miss Kate's
father bought it. Although Uncle Cinto claims to be 111, he says he was
named San Jacinto because he was born during the "San Jacinto War",
which would make his age 101.*


"Yes, suh, I's Cinto. That's Lucy over there, she my wife and I calls
her Red Heifer, 'cause her papa's name was Juan and he was a Mexican.
She and me marry right after 'mancipation. We come long way and we goin'
to die together.


"They named me San Jacinto 'cause I's born durin' de San Jacinto war,
but they calls me Cinto. I's born in Fort Bend County, up near Richmond,
and my old marster was Marse Dave Randon, and his wife, Miss Nancy, was
my missus. She was sister to Marse John McNeel, what with his brothers
owned all de land hereabouts.


"I 'members once I slips away come dark from de plantation, with some
others. We is slippin' 'long quiet like and a paddle roller jump out
from behin' a bush and say, 'Let's see your pass.' We didn't have none
but I has a piece of paper and I gives it to him and he walks to where
it am more light, and then we run, right through old burdock bushes with
briars stickin' us and everything. Iffen he cotched us we sho' gits a
hidin'.


"I fust went to de field when I 'bout 15 year old, but they larned us to
work when we was chaps, we would he'p our mammas in de rows. My mamma's
name Maria Simmons and my papa, Lewis. They rared me up right.


"Marse Dave wasn't mean like some. Sometimes de slaves run away to de
woods and iffen they don't cotch 'em fust they finally gits hongry and
comes home, and then they gits a hidin'. Some niggers jus' come from
Africa and old Marse has to watch 'em close, 'cause they is de ones what
mostly runs away to de woods.


"We had better houses then, good plank houses, and de big house was sho'
big and nice. 'Course they didn't larn us read and write, and didn't
'low no church, but us steal off and have it sometimes, and iffen old
Marse cotch us he give us a whalin'. We didn't have no funerals like
now, they jus' dig a hole and make you a box, and throw you in and cover
you up. But de white folks fed us good and give us good clothes. We wore
red russet shoes and good homespun clothes, and we done better'n now.


"Come Christmas time old marse sometimes give us two-bits and lots of
extra eats. Iffen it come Monday, we has de week off. But we has to
watch the eats, 'cause niggers what they marsters don't give 'em no
Christmas sneak over and eat it all up. Sometimes we have dances, and
I'd play de fiddle for white folks and cullud folks both. I'd play,
'Young Girl, Old Girl', 'High Heel Shoes,' and 'Calico Stockings.'


"When we was freed we was all glad, but I stayed 'round and worked for
Marse Dave and he pays me a little. Finally Lucy and me gits married out
of de Book and comes down here to Marse McNeel's. They puts us in debt
and makes us work so many years to pay for it. They gives us our own
ground and sometimes we makes two bales of cotton on it. 'Course, we
works for them, too, and they pays us a little and when Christmas comes
we can buy our own things. I used to haul sugar and 'lasses for Papa
John up to Brazoria and sometimes to Columbia.


"Yes, suh, I been here a long time, long time. All my own stuff is dead
now, I guess. I got grandchillen in Galveston, I think, but all my own
stuff is dead."








Hagar Lewis




*Hagar Lewis, tall and erect at 82 years of age, lives at 4313 Rosa St.,
El Paso, Texas. She was born a slave of the Martin family and was given
with her mother and family to Mary Martin, when she married John M.
McFarland. They lived near Tyler, Smith Co., Texas. When freed she
remained with the McFarlands until she married A. Lewis and moved to San
Antonio, Texas. Widowed early, she raised two sons. One, chief
electrical engineer with the U.S. government, lives in New York City. He
provides for his aged mother.*


[HW: Illegible]


"I was born Jan. 12th, 1855. My first owners was the Martins, and when
their daughter, Mary, married, I was give to her. My mama lived to 112
years old. She had sixteen children. I was the baby.


"Missus Mary McFarland, my mother's missus and mine, taught us children
with her own; learned us how to read and write. She treated us just like
we were her children. We had very strict leaders, my mother and Missus
Mary. She'd say, 'Mammy Lize (my mother), 'you'll have to come and whop
Oscar and Hagar, they's fightin!' Mammy Lize would say, 'No, I won't
whop 'em, I'll just punish 'em.' And we'd have to stand with our backs
to each other. My missus never did much whoppin'.


"We lived in cabins made of logs and chinked with mud mortar. We had
beds that had only one leg; they fit in each corner of the walls. They
was strong, stout. We could jump on 'em and have lots of fun. We didn'
stay in quarters much. The cabins was near a creek where willows grew
and we'd make stick horses out of 'em. We called it our horse lot. On
the farm was a spring that threw water high, and we'd go fishing in a
big lake on one corner of the farm. Marster owned half a league, maybe
more.


"I was 12 years old when freed. I can remember the way my marster come
home from the war. The oldest son, Oscar, and I was out in the yard, and
I saw marster first, comin' down the road, and I hollered and screamed,
'O, Oscar, Marse John's a-comin! Marse John's a-comin' home!' We stayed
on with them 'till they all died off but Oscar.


"We never changed our name 'till after the Civil War. Then Marse John
said, 'Mammy Lize, you gotta choose a name.' He carried us into Tyler to
a bureau or something. Mammy Lize say, 'I'm going to keep the name
McFarland. I ain't got no other name.'


"My father was a slave from another farm. My mother was the cook. She
cooked it all in the same place for white folks and us. We ate the same,
when the white folks was finished. They's a big light bread oven in the
yard of the big house and in front of the quarters, under a big tree.
That one baked the pies. The cabins had a big fireplace wider than that
piano there. They'd hang meat and sausage and dry them in the fireplace.
Cut holes in ham and hang them there. Had big hogsheads filled up with
flour, corn and wheat.


"Some pore niggers were half starved. They belonged to other people.
Missus Mary would call them in to feed 'em, see 'em outside the fence
pickin' up scraps. They'd call out at night, 'Marse John, Marse John.'
They's afraid to come in daytime. Marse John'd say, 'What's the matter
now?' They'd say, 'I'se hongry.' He'd say, 'Come in and git it.' He'd
cure lots of meat, for we'd hear 'em hollerin' at night when they'd beat
the pore niggers for beggin' or stealin', or some crime.


"Marse John would saddle up Old Charlie and go see. He had a big shot
gun across his lap. We'd hear that ole bull whip just a poppin'. They'd
turn 'em loose when Marse John got after 'em. He prosecuted some
marsters for beatin' the slaves. He knew they was half feedin' 'em. One
time he let us go see where they'd drug two niggers to death with oxen.
For stealin' or somethin'. I can't say we were treated bad, 'cause I'd
tell a story. I've always been treated good by whites, but many of the
niggers was killed. They'd say bad words to the bosses and they'd shoot
'em. We'd ask Miss Mary why did they kill old Uncle so and so, and Miss
Mary would say, 'I don't know. It's not right to say when you don't
know.' I'm glad to see slavery over.


"When I was turned loose Miss Mary was training me and sister to do
handwork, knittin' and such. Mama wouldn't let us dance, didn't want any
rough children. Miss Mary'd say, when I'd get sleepy, 'Owl eyes, ain't
you sleepy?' I'd say, 'No, ma'am, anything you want us to do?' I cried
to sleep in the big house with Miss Mary and the children, 'cause my
sister Belle did. Said she's goin' to turn white 'cause she stayed with
the white folks, and I wanted to turn white, too.


"Miss Mary'd make our Sunday dresses. My mother put colored thread in
woven material and they was pretty. We had plenty of clothes. Miss Mary
saw to that. They paid my mother for every child she had that was big
enough to work, and Marse John saw that others did the same.


"Some whites had a dark hole in the ground, a 'dungeon,' they called it,
to put their slaves in. They'd carry 'em bread and water once a day.
I'se afraid of the hole, they'd tell me the devil was in that hole.




[Illustration: _Hagar Lewis_]




"We set traps for 'possum, coons and squirrels. We used to have big
sport ridin' goats. One near busted me wide open. Miss Mary's brother
put me on it, and they punished him good for it. He didn't get to play
for a long time. And we had an old buck sheep. He'd keep Oscar and I up
on the oak patch fence all the time.


"We'd watch the doodle bugs build their houses. We'd sing, 'Doodle,
Doodle, your house burned down.' Those things would come up out of their
holes just a-shakin'.


"One game I remember was, 'Skip frog, Skip frog, Answer your Mother,
she's callin' you, you, you.' We'd stand in a circle and one would be
skip frog. We'd slap our hands and skip frog would be hoppin' just like
frogs do. Oh, I wish I could call them times back again. I'd go back
tomorrow. But I'm tryin' to live so I can meet 'em once again."








Henry Lewis




*Henry Lewis was born in 1835, at Pine Island, in Jefferson Co., Texas.
He was owned by Bob Cade. Henry's voice is low and somewhat indistinct
and it was evidently a strain on his vocal chords and also on his
memory, to tell the story of his life. He lives with one of his
daughters, in Beaumont, who supports him, with the aid of his pension.*


"Old Bob Cade, he my massa, and Annie Cade, she my missus. Dey had a big
plantation over in Louisiana and 'nother in Jefferson County, out at
Pine Island. I's born a hunnerd and one year ago, on Christmas Day, out
at Pine Island. If I lives to see next Christmas day 'gain, I'll be a
hunerd two year old.


"My mammy she come from Mis'sippi and she name' Judy Lewis. Washington
Lewis, one de slaves on Massa Bob's Louisiana plantation, he my daddy. I
can't 'member nobody else 'cept my greatgramma, Patsy. She's 130 when
she die. She look awful, but den she my folks. My own dear mammy was 112
year old when she die. She have ten chillen and de bigges' portion dem
born in slavery time. Dey two sister older'n me, Mandy and Louise. I
name' after my daddy brudder, Henry Lewis.


"My white folks have a plantation in Louisiana, at Caginly, and stay
over dere mos' de time. I 'member when old Massa Bob used to come to
Pine Island to stay a month or two, all us li'l chillen gather round him
and he used to throw out two bitses and big one cent pieces 'mongst us,
jis' to see us scrammel for dem. When Christmas time come round dey give
us Christmas gift and a whole week for holiday.


"I never been no nearer east dan Lake Charles and dat been lately, so I
ain't never see de old plantation. At Pine Island us have de big woods
place with a hunerd workin' hands, without de underlin's (children). All
he niggers say Cade de good man. He hire he overseers and say, 'You can
correct dem for dey own good and make dem work right, but you ain't
better cut dey hide or draw no blood.' He git a-holt some mean overseers
but dey don't tarry long. He find out dey beatin' he niggers and den he
beat dem and say, 'How dat suit you?'


"Old massa he a big, stocky Irishman with sandy hair and he ain't had no
beard or mustache. When he grow old he have de gout and he put de long
mattress out on de gallery and lay down on it. He say, 'Come here, my
li'l niggers,' and den he make us rub he foots so he kin git to sleep.


"Dey used to have old slavery-day jedge and jury of white folks and dey
hear de case and 'cide how many lashes to give de darky. Dey put de lash
on dem, but dey never put no jail on dem. I seed some slaves in chains
and I heared of one massa what had de place in de fence with de hole cut
out for de nigger's neck. Dey hist up de board and de nigger put he head
through de hole and den dey beat him with a lash with holes bored in it
and every hole raise de blister. Den he bus' dem blisters with de
handsaw and dey put salt and pepper in de bucket water and 'noint dem
blisters with de mop dip in de water. Dey do dat when dey in 'ticular
bad humor, iffen de nigger ain't chop 'nough cotton or corn. Sometime a
overseer kilt a nigger, and dey don't do nothin' to him 'cept make him
pay for de nigger. But our massa good.


"Old massa 'low us praise Gawd but lots of massas didn't 'low dem to git
on de knees. Us have church-house and de white folks go in de mornin'
and us go after dinner. Us used to sing:


    "'My knee bones achin',
    My body's rackin' with pain,
    I calls myself de chile of Gawd,
    Heaven am my aim.
    If you don't 'lieve I's a chile of Gawd,
    Jis' meet me on dat other shore,
    Heaven is my home.
    I calls myself a chile of Gawd,
    I's a long time on my way,
    But Heaven am my home.'


"Old massa have de house make out hand-sawed planks in slavery time. It
put together with home-made nails, dem spike, square nails dey make
deyselfs. It have de long gallery on it. De slaves have li'l log cabin
house with mud-cat chimney on de side and de furn'ture mostly Georgia
hosses for beds and mattress make out tow sacks. Dey no floor in dem
house, 'cept what Gawd put in dem.


"When I six or seven year old dey 'cides I's big 'nough to start ridin'
hosses. Dey have de big cattle ranch and I ride all over dis territory.
I's too li'l to git on de hoss and dey lift me up, and dey have de real
saddle for me, too. I couldn't git up, but I sho' could stay up when I
git dere, I's jis' like a hoss-fly.


"Beaumont was jis' a briarpatch in dem time. Jis' one li'l store and one
blacksmith shop, and Massa John Herring he own dat. Dat de way I first
see my wife, ridin' de range. De Cade brand was a lazy RC [TR: letters R
and C turned 90 degrees] dat done register 'fore I's born. Us brand from
de first of March to de 15th of December.


"Old massa have de big field 'vided in trac's and each slave could have
a part and raise what he want, and old massa buy de crop from de slave.
He's purty good to he slaves, and us have good clothes, too, wool for
winter and cotton for summer. Us have six suit de year, unnerwear and
all. Dey a trunk like in de cabin for Sunday clothes and de res' hang on
a peg.


"Us have plenty good food to eat, too. Beef and hawgs and bacon and
syrup and sugar and flour was plenty. All de possums and rabbits and
fish and sich was jis' dat much more. He give us de barrel whiskey every
year, too.


"Dey 'low de li'l chillen lots of playtime and no hard task. Us play
stick hoss and seven-up marble game with marbles us make and de 'well
game.' De gal or boy sot in de chair and lean way back and 'tend like
dey in de well. Dey say dey so many feet down and say, 'Who you want
pull you out?' And de one you want pull you out, dey sposed to kiss you.


"Dey used to be nigger traders what come through de country with de herd
of niggers, jis' like cattlemen with de herd of cattle. Dey fix camp and
de pen on de ridge of town and people what want to buy more slaves go
dere. Dey have a block and make de slaves git up on dat. Maybe one man
say, 'I give you, $200.00,' and when dey's through de slave sold to de
highes' bidder. Old massa warn us look out and not let de trader cotch
us, 'cause a trader jis' soon steal a nigger and sell him.


"De patterrollers come round befo' de war to see iffen de massas treat
dere slaves good. My wife's gramma say dey come round to her massa's
place, but befo' dey git dere he take a meat skin and make dem rub it
round dey mouth and git dey face all greasy so it look like dey have
plenty to eat and he tell dem dey better tell de patterrollers dey
gittin' plenty to eat. But dere one big nigger and he say, 'Hell, no, he
ain't give us 'nough to eat.' Den dat nigger say, 'Please take me with
you, 'cause if you don't massa gwineter kill me when you git gone.'


"Old massa he die befo' de war and den he son, John Cade, take over de
place, and he brudders help. Dey name' Overton and Taylor and Bob,
Junior. Us all want to git free and talk 'bout it in de quarters 'mongst
ourselfs, but we ain't say nothin' where de white folks heared us.


"When war come on I seed sojers every day. Dey have de camp in Liberty
and I watches dem. I heared de guns, too, maybe at Sabine Pass, but I
didn't see no actual fightin'. Dat a long year to wait, de las' year de
war. Dey sont de papers down on March 5th, I done heared, but dey didn't
turn us loose den. Dis de last state to turn de slaves free. When dey
didn't let dem go in March, de Yankee sojers come in June and make dem
let us go. Next mornin' after de sojers come, de overseer reads de
papers out and say we's free as he is and we can go. Some stay on de old
place a long time and some go off. You know dey jis' slaves and wasn't
civilize'. Some ain't never git civilize' jet. Old massa never give us
nothin', but he told us we would stay on iffen we want, but I left.


"I goes down close to Anahuac and builds a li'l log cabin at Monroe
City, and dat's where dey puttin' in oil wells now. Washington Lewis,
dat my daddy, he have 129 acres dere. De white folks say to sign de
paper to let dem put de well on it and dey give us $50.00 and us sign
dat paper and dey have de land.


"I marries in slavery time, when I's 'bout 22 year old. My first wife
name' Rachel an she live on Double Bayou. She belong to de Mayes place.
I see her when I ridin' de range for Massa Bob. I tells massa I wants to
git marry and he make ma ask Massa Mayes and us have de big weddin'. She
dress all in white. I have de nice hat and suit of black clothes and
daddy a shoemaker and make me de good pair of shoes to git marry in. Us
stand front Massa Mayes and he read out de Bible. Us had a real big
supper and some de white folks give us money.


"De first money I makes am workin' for de gov'ment in Galveston. After
de war de gov'ment hire folks to clean up de trash what de fightin' make
and I am hired. Dey lots of wood and stones and brick and trees and sich
dem big guns knock down.


"I goes back to ridin' de prairie and rides till I's 94 year old. I
stops de same year Mr. Joe Hebert dies. When I quits I's out workin',
tendin' Mr. Langham's chickens and I forgits it Christmas and my
birthday till Mr. Langham comes ridin' out with my money. Dat's de last
work I done and dat in 1931 and I's 94 year old, like I say. I bet dese
nineteen hunerd niggers ain't gwine live dat long.


"I didn't had no chillen by my first wife and she been dead 'bout 70
year now. My last wife name' Charlotte and she been dead 22 year and us
have 16 chillen. Dey six gals and ten boys and ten am livin' now. Mos'
of dem am too old to work now. I stays with Ada, here, and she got a
gif'. She know what kind of herb am good for medicine for diff'rent
ailments. She born with a veil over de face and am wise to dem things.
Dey's de fever weed and de debil's shoestring, and fleaweed cures
neuralgy and toothache. Spanish mulberry root, dat good for kidneys.
When anybody git swolled feets give dem wild grapevine. Prickly ash bark
good for dat, too. Red oak bark good for women's troubles and pumpkin
head for de heart. Camphor and asafoetida in de bag round de neck good
for de heart. When de chile git convulsion make dem drink li'l bluin'.
Dat good for growed-up folks, too. It good for burns, too."








Lucy Lewis




*Lucy Lewis, wife of Cinto Lewis, does not know her age, but is very
aged in appearance, about four feet tall and weighs around 65 or 70
pounds. She was born on the McNeel plantation at Pleasant Grove, land
now occupied by No. 2 Camp of the Clemens Prison Farm. Her master was
Johnny McNeel, brother of J. Greenville McNeel. His sister married Dave
Randon, Cinto's master. Cinto and Lucy's cabin is furnished with an
enormous four-poster bed and some chairs. Pots, pans, kettles and jugs
hang on the walls. The fireplace has a skillet and beanpot in the ashes.
The old people are almost blind.*


"You all white folks jus' set a bit while I eats me a little breakfast.
I got me a little flap jack and some clabber here. Dem old flies gobble
it up for me, don't I git to it fust. Me and Cinto 'bout starve, old
hard time 'bout git us. I sure wishes I could find some of Marse John
Dickinson's folks, I sho' go to them.


"Me and Cinto got nine head grandchillen down in Galveston, but dey
don't write or nothin'. All our own children are dead. Dey was Lottie
and Louisa and Alice. Dey was John, too, but he was so little and
scrawny he die when he a month old. We call him after Marse John, which
we all love so much.


"My mama's name was Lottie Hamilton and she was born at de Cranby Camp
for Johnny McNeel. My papa was a Mexican and went by name of Juan.


"I don't hardly recollec' when we git married. I hardly turn fifteen and
dey was fat on dese here old bones den, and I had me a purty white
calico dress to git married in. It was low in de neck with ruffles and
de sleeves come to my elbow purty like. We sho' had de finest kind of a
time when Cinto and me gits married, we-all fishes down on de bayou all
day long. Marse John marry us right out of de Bible.


"I were bred and born in No. 2 Camp over thar, but it called McNeel
Plantation at Pleasant Grove in them days. It was Greenville McNeel's
brother and his sister, Nancy, marry Dave Randon. When my marster and
wife separate, de wife took part de slaves and de marster took some
others and us and we come down here.


"I had five brothers and one sister and I jus' 'member, Cinto' s
step-pappy try cross de ribber on a log in high water and a old
alligator swaller him right up.


"My marster and his missy were mighty good to us, mighty good. We used
to wear good clothes--real purty clothes--most as good as dat Houston
cloth you-all wearin'. And, sho' 'nough, I had some purty red russet
shoes. When we-all real good, Marse John used to give us small money to
buy with. I spent mos' of mine to buy clothes. We used to go barefoot
and only when I go to church and dances I wore my shoes.


"We sho' had some good dances in my young days, when I was spry. We used
to cut all kind of steps, de cotillion and de waltz and de shotty
(schottische) and all de rest de dances of dat time. My preacher used to
whup me did he hear I go to dances, but I was a right smart dancin' gal.
I was little and sprite and all dem young bucks want to dance with me.


"Cinto didn't know how to do no step, but he could fiddle. Dere was a
old song which come back to me, 'High heels and Calico Stockin's.'


    "'Fare you well, Miss Nancy Hawkins,
    High heel shoes and calico stockin's.'


"I can't sing now from de time I lost my teeth with de Black John fever.
When I git dat fever, my missy told me not to drink a mite of water
'cepting she told me to. I git so hot I jus' can't stand it and done
drink a two-pint bucket of water, and my teeth drop right out.


"Missy sho' good to me. Dey 'bout 20 slaves but I stay in de house all
de time. Our house have two big rooms and a kitchen and de boys and men
have rooms apart like little bitty houses on de outside. When we don't

to green up de house for company I gits up earlier.


"Missy Nancy used to whup me if I done told a lie, but I didn't git
whupped often. She used to whup me with a cattle whup made out of
cowhide.


"Some of de slaves wore charms round dey necks, little bags of
asfeddity. Me, I got me three vaccinations--dat all I need.


"We used to git lots to eat, greens and suet, fish from de ribber,
cornmeal and plenty of sugar, even in de war time. Soldiers was around
here as thick as weeds. We had to give 'em a tithe of corn and we makes
clothes for 'em, and bandages and light jackets. We made de heavy leaded
jackets, with lead in de skirts of de coat to hold it down. De lead
looked like a marble and we cut it in long strips and hammer it down.


"One of dem Yank gunboats come up de river and shell around here. Right
here. Dem shells come whistlin' through de trees and lop de limbs right

Amos Lincoln




*Amos Lincoln, 85, was born a slave of Elshay Guidry, whose plantation
was in the lower delta country of Louisiana, about fifty miles south of
New Orleans. His memories of slave days are somewhat vague. He has lived
in Beaumont fifty-two years.*


"My tongue's right smart I think. I's ten year old when they blew up
that fort. I mean Fort Jackson. Grandpa was cookin'. They wouldn't let
him fight. The fort was in New Orleans. They kilt lots of people. They
bore holes in the ground and blow it up. A square hole, you know, a
machine went in there. A man could crawl in the hole, yes, yes, sho'.
The fort was long side the river. They bore holes from the river bank.
They had a white paper, a order for 'em not to come to New Orleans. They
drag cannon in the hole and shoot up the fort.


"Soon's freedom come my pa and ma was squatters on gov'ment land. It was
good land and high land. My pa had 'bout 100 acres. One night somebody
come shoot him. Shoot him in the back. Ma took the chillen to Shady
Bayou to grandpa.


"My grandpa come from Africy. I never see my other people 'cause dey
'longs to other masters. My grandpa die when he 115 year old.


"Elisha Guidry he my master in slavery. He had lots of slaves. He whip
my pa lots of times. He was unwillin' to work. He whip my ma, too. One
time he cut her with the whip and cut one her big toes right off. Ma
come up on the gallery and wrap it up in a piece of rag.


"Us have a dirt house. The chimney made with mud. It's a good house. It
hot in summer. The beds made with moss and shucks and the big old ticks
made at the big house. Us didn't have no chairs. Jes' benches. In the
room's a big trough. Us sit 'round the trough and eat clabber and bread
with big, wood spoon. I eat many a meal that way myself.


"Dem's moral times. A gal's 21 'fore she marry. They didn't go wanderin'
'round all hours. They mammies knowed where they was. Folks nowadays is
wild and weak. The gals dress up come Sunday. All week they wear they
hair all roll up with cotton they unfold from the cotton boll. Sunday
come they comb the hair out fine. No grease on it. They want it natural
curly.


"Us have good food most time. Steel and log traps fo' big game. Pit
traps in the woods 'bout so long and so deep, and kivered with bresh and
leaves. That cotch possum and coon and other things what come 'long in
the night. Us lace willow twigs and strings and put a cross piece on top
and bottom, and little piece of wood on top edge. The trap 'bout two
feet off the ground to cotch the birds. Doves, blackbirds, any kind
birds you can eat. Us clean them li'l birds good and rub 'em down in
lard. After they set awhile us broil 'em with plenty black pepper and
salt. Us shoot plenty ducks with musket, too.


"Greens was good, too. Us eat parsley greens and shuglar weed. That big,
two foot plant what have red flower on it. Us git lots of 'em in Wade's
Bayou. Us put li'l bit flour in ashes and make ashcake. Us cook pumpkin
in ashes, too.


"After slavery I hoe cotton. No money at first, jes' work on halves. The
trouble that there no equal halves. The white folks pay jes' like they
wants. A man couldn't work that way no time. I had to come over to Texas
'cause a man what want my land say I stoled a barrel from he house. He
try arres' my old woman 'cause she say she find the barrel. Now, I never
have the case in lawsuit and I 'spect to die that way. But I has to stay
'way from Mauriceville for three year 'cause that man say I thiefed he
barrel.


"Things was bad after us come to Texas for a time. That Lizal Scizche,
he sho' rough man. Us cropped on the share and he take the crop and the
money and lef' fast. Us didn't have a mess of nothin' left.


"I manages to live by croppin'. I been here 52 year now. My first wife
name Massanne Florshann, that the French. My wife what I got now name
Annie. Massanne she give me six chillen and Annie four."








Annie Little




*Annie Little, 81, was born a slave of Bill Gooden, in Springfield,
Missouri. Her master owned a plantation in Mississippi, and sent Annie's
family there while she was a baby. Annie now lives in Mart, Texas.*


"I's first a baby in Springfield. Dat in Missouri and dere am where I's
birthed in January, 1856. My daddy and mammy was Howard and Annie and
dey 'longed to Massa Bill Gooden. He have de plantation in Missipp' and
send us dere while I's still de li'l baby. Dat am what dey call de Delta
now, and de cotton so high I clumb up in de trees to reach de top of de
stalks, and de corn so high a man on he mule only have de top he hat
showin'.


"If us mind massa and missus, dey good to us, but if de hands lazy and
not work den de overseer whop dem. When dey run 'way he sot de
bloodhounds on dem and dey clumb de tree. I's heared dem hounds bayin'
de nigger up a tree jes' lots of times. Massa never sold none my family
and we stays with him till he wife die and he die, too.


"In de cold days de women spin and weave de cloth on looms. I stands by
and pick up de shuttle when dey fall. Us niggers all wore de clothes
make on de spinnin' wheel, but de white folks wore dresses from de
store. Dey have to pay fifty and seventy-five cents de yard for calico
den.




[Illustration: _Annie Little_]




"Den de war come. I 'member how massa come home on de furlough and when
word come he on de way, us all git ready for de big cel'bration. Dey
kill the yearlin' or hawg and all us niggers cook for de big feast.
Sometimes iffen he stay a week, we jes' do nothin' but eat and cook.


"Dem de good old days, but dey didn't last, for de war am over to sot de
slaves free and old massa ask if we'll stay or go. My folks jes' stays
till I's a growed gal and gits married and has a home of my own. Den my
old man tell me how de Yankees stoled him from de fields. Dey some
cavalry sojers and dey make him take care of de hosses. He's 'bout twict
as old as me, and he say he was in de Bull Run Battle. He's capture in
one battle and run 'way and 'scape by de holp of a Southern regiment and
fin'ly come back to Mississip'. He like de war songs like 'Marchin'
Through Georgia,' but bes' of all he like dis song:


    "'I ain't gwine study war no more,
    i gwine lay down my burden,
    down by de river side,
    down by de river side.


    "'Gwine lay down my sword and shield
    Down by de riverside,
    Down by de riverside.


    "'I ain't gwine study war no more,
    Gwine try on my starry crown,
    Down by de river side,
    Down by de river side.'


"Well, he done lay he burden down and quit dis world in 1916.


"Do I 'member any hant stories? Well, we'd sit round de fire in de
wintertime and tell ghos' stories till us chillen 'fraid to go to bed at
night. Iffen I can 'lect, I'll tell you one. Dis story am 'bout a old,
haunted house, a big, old house with two front rooms down and two front
rooms up and a hall runnin' from back to front. In back am de li'l house
where Alex, massa's boy kep' he hoss, stay.


"Dis big house face de river. Old Massa go to war and never come back no
more. Old missy jes' wait and wait, till fin'ly dey all say she am weak
in de head. Every day she tell de niggers to kill de pig, dat massa be
home today. Every day she fix up in de Sunday best and wait for him. It
go on like dat for years and years, till old miss am gone to be with old
massa, and de niggers all left and dere am jes' de old house left.


"One day long time after freedom Alex come back, and he hair turned
white. He go up de river to de old plantation to tell Old Miss dat Old
Massa gone to he Heavenly Home, and won't be back to de old place. He
come up to de old house and de front gate am offen de hinges and de
grass high as he head, and de blinds all hangin' sideways and rattle
with de wind. Dey ain't no lightnin' bug and no crickets on de
fireplace, jes' de old house and de wind a-blowin' through de window
blinds and moanin' through de trees.


"Old Alex so broke up he jes' sot down on de steps and 'fore he knowed
it he's asleep. He saw Old Massa and hisself gwine to war and Old Massa
am on he white hoss and he new gray uniform what de women make for him,
and de band am playin' Dixie. Old Alex seed hisself ridin' he li'l roan
pony by Old Massa's side. Den he dream o' after de battle when he look
for Old Massa and finds him and he hoss lyin' side by side, done gone to
where dere ain't no more war. He buries him, and--den de thunder and
lightnin' make Alex wake up and he look in Old Miss' room and dere she
am, jes' sittin' in her chair, waitin' for Old Massa. Old Alex go to
talk with her and she fade 'way. Alex stay in he li'l old cabin waitin'
to tell Old Miss, and every time it come rain and lightnin' she allus
sot in her chair and go 'way 'fore he git in her room. So Old Alex
fin'ly goes to sleep forever, but he never left he place of watchin' for
Old Miss.


"De white folks and niggers what live in dem days wouldn't live in dat
big, old house, so it am call de 'hanted house by de river.' It stands
all 'lone for years and years, till de new folks from up North come and
tore it down." (See pictures of house at end of story.)


"I well 'lect my old man sayin' how de steamboat come whistlin' up de
river and all de darkies go to singin', 'Steamboat Comin' Round da
Bend.' Dis am in de cotton patch jes' 'yond da hanted house and de
steamboat whistle mean time to go to dinner. Dat am de Little Red River
up in Arkansas, where my old man, Dolphus Little, am birthed, right near
de hanted house.


"Dolphus and me marries in Missipp' but come to Texas and lives at
Hillsboro on Massa John Willoughby's farm. We has ten chillen and I'm
livin' with my baby boy right now. I'll tell you de song I gits all dem
chillen to sleep with:


    "Mammy went 'way--she tell me to stay,
    And take good care of de baby.
    She tell me to stay and sing disaway,
    O, go to sleepy, li'l baby,


    "O, shut you eye and don't you cry,
    Go to sleepy, li'l baby.
    'Cause mammy's boun' to come bime-by,
    O, go to sleepy, li'l baby.


    "We'll stop up de cracks and sew up de seams,
    De booger man never shall cotch you.
    O, go to sleep and dream sweet dreams,
    De booger man never shall cotch you.


    "De river run wide, de river run deep,
    O, bye-o, sweet li'l baby.
    Dat boat rock slow, she'll rock you to sleep,
    O, bye-o, sweet li'l baby.


      Chorus


    "O, go to sleepy, sleepy, li'l baby,
    'Cause when you wake, you'll git some cake,
    And ride a li'l white hossy.
    O, de li'l butterfly, he stole some pie,
    Go to sleepy, li'l baby.
    And flew so high till he put out his eye,
    O, go to sleepy, li'l baby."














Abe Livingston




*Abe Livingston, 83 years old, was born a slave to Mr. Luke Hadnot,
Jasper Co., Texas, the owner of about 70 slaves. He now lives in
Beaumont, Texas.*


"I done well in slavery, 'cause I belonged to Massa Luke Hadnot and he
had some boys and they and me grew up together. When my daddy beat me
I'd go up to the big house and stay there with the boys and we'd git
something to eat from the kitchen. When de white folks has et, we gits
what lef'. Massa Luke done well by his niggers, he done better'n mos' of
'em.


"Us boys, white boys and me, had lots of fun when us growin' up. I
'member the games us play and we'd sing this:


    "'Marly Bright, Marly Bright,
      Three score and ten;
    Kin you git up by candlelight?
      Yes, iffen your legs
    Are long and limber and light.'


"Sometimes us boys, not the white ones 'cause they couldn', would go in
the woods and stay all night. We builds campfires and watches for
witches and hants. I seen some but what they was I don' know. By the
waterhole, one tall white hant used to come nearly every night. I
couldn' say much how it looked, 'cause I was too scart to git close.




[Illustration: _Abe Livingston_]




"I was jus' about big enough to handle the mule when the war bust out.
My daddy was a servant in the army and he helped dig the breastwork
round Mansfield for the battle.


"News of the freedom come 'bout 9 or 10 o'clock on a Tuesday morning.
Mos' us goes home and stays there till nex' Monday. Then Yankees come
and told us we's free. About 80 of 'em come and they sho' laughed a lot,
like they's glad war is through. Seem like they's more for eatin' than
anything else and dey steal the good hosses. They take everything to
eat, and 40 big gobblers and they eat the hawgs and beeves, too. How
them Yankees could eat! I never seen nothin' like it.


"I come to Jefferson County after freedom and got me a job. It was
spikin' on the railroad. Freedom didn' mean much to me, 'cause I didn'
know the difference. I done well anyhow."








John Love




*John Love, 76, was born near Crockett, Texas, a slave of John Smelley.
John tells of the days of Reconstruction, and life in the river bottoms.
He now lives in Marlin, Texas.*


"I's born on de Neches River and spends all my earlies' life right down
in de river bottoms, 'cause I done live in de Brazos bottom, too. Mammy
and pappy 'longed to John Smelley and was Rose and John.


"It was wild down in de Neches bottom den, plenty bears and panthers and
deers and wolves and catamounts, and all kind birds and wild turkeys.
Jes' a li'l huntin' most allus fill de pot dem days. De Indians traps de
wild animals and trade de hides for supplies. We was right near to de
Cherokee and Creek res'vation. I knowed lots of Indians, and some what
was Alabama Indians and done come over here. Dey said de white people
was wrong when dey thinks Alabama mean 'here we rest.' It don't mean dat
a-tall. It mean "people what gathers mulberries.' You see, dem Alabama
Indians right crazy 'bout mulberries and has a day for a feast when de
mulberries gits ripe. Dat where de tribe git its name and de town named
after de tribe.


"Massa Smelley fit in de Mexico War and in de Freedom War, but I don't
know nothin' 'bout de battles. De bigges' thing I 'members am when de
soldiers come back, 'cause dey finds all dey cattle stoled or dead. De
soldiers, both kinds, de 'Federates and Yankees, done took what dey
want. De plantations all growed up in weeds and all de young slaves
gone, and de ones what stayed was de oldes' and faithfulles'.


"Times was hard and no money, and if dere wasn't plenty wild animals
everybody done starve. But after 'while, new folks come in, and has some
money and things picks up a li'l more'n more.


"We has de sugar cane and makes sorghum, and has our own mill. Us all,
mammy and pappy and us chillun, done stay with Massa Smelley long time
after freedom, 'cause we ain't got nowhere to go or nothin'. I'd holp in
de 'lasses mill, and when we grinds dat cane to cook into syrup, dis am
de song:


    "'Ain't no more cane on de Neches,
    Ain't no more cane on de land;
    Oh---- ooooo---- ooooo---- oO!
    Done grind it all in 'lasses,
    Oh---- ooooo---- ooooo---- oO!


"After I's 'bout growed, I moves to de Brazos bottom and works for a
stockman, den I works for de man what driv de first post on de Houston &
Texas Central right-of-way. I holped build dat railroad from Houston to
Waco, and build de fences and lay de cross-tires. Den I broke wild
hosses for Mr. Curry. He give me my groceries and twenty-five cents a
day. I was sho' proud of de job.


"After dis, I carries de mail from Marlin to Eddy, on hossback. De roads
went through de Brazos bottom. Dey was jes' cowtrails, 'stead of roads.
Dere was a road through dat bottom so bad de white man wouldn't carry
dat mail, so dey gives it to me and I ain't got no better sense dan to
try it. Dat six miles through de bottom was all mudholes and when de
river git out de banks dat was bad. But I helt out for eight years, till
de mail sent by train.


"I knows why dat boll-weevil done come. Dey say he come from Mexico, but
I think he allus been here. Away back yonder a spider live in de
country, 'specially in de bottoms. He live on de cotton leaves and
stalks, but he don't hurt it. Dese spiders kep' de insects eat up. Dey
don't plow deep den, and plants cotton in February, so it made 'fore de
insects git bad.


"Den dey gits to plowin' deep, and it am colder 'cause de trees all cut,
and dey plows up all de spiders and de cold kill dem. Dey plants later,
and dere ain't no spiders left to eat up de boll-weevil.


"I knows an old boll-weevil song, what us sing in de fields:


    "De bollweevil is a li'l bug, from Mexico, dey say,
    He come try dis Texas soil, and think he better stay,
    A-lookin' for a home--jes' lookin' for a home.


    "De farmer took de bollweevil and put him in de sand.
    Boll weevil said to farmer, 'I'll stand it like a man,
    For it's jes' my home--it's jes' my home.'


    "First time I seed de weevil, he on de eastern train,
    Nex' time I seed dat weevil, he on de Memphis train,
    A-lookin' for a home--jes' lookin' for a home.


    "If anybody axes you who writ dis li'l song,
    It's jes' a dark-skin nigger, with old blue duckin's on."








Louis Love




*Louis Love, 91, was born in Franklin, Louisiana, a slave of Donaltron
Cafrey, whom Louis describes as a "leadin' lawyer and once United States
Senator." At the start of the Civil War, Louis was sent to Texas with
about 300 other slaves to escape the "Yankee invaders." Louis now lives
in Orange, Texas, and says he spends most of his time sitting on the
gallery. One hand shakes constantly and his reedy voice is tremulous.*


"Well, I guess I's 'bout 91 year old. I 'member when freedom come. I
goes up to reg'stration de year I gits free. I walks up to old Doc Young
and say, 'I come reg'ster for de vote.' He say, 'You too young to vote.
You ask your missus.' Missus git de big book 'bout six inch thick where
she got all de births and deaths on dat place since she been missus and
she give me a letter sayin' I nineteen year old. I kep' dat letter till
not so long ago and burns it by mistake, 'cause I can't read.


"Dave Love he was my daddy and Tildy Love was my mama. My grandmama

States senator. When Senator Gibson die massa he serve out he term.
Young massa name Donaltron Cafrey, junior, and he keep de big bank in
New Orleans now.


"I never was sold to nobody. I heared folks say my folks come from
Kentucky, but my mama born on Massa Cafrey's place. He have de big
house, fine old house with galleries all 'round and big lawns. It's far
back from de road, pushin' clost to a mile, I guess. He have seven sugar
plantation and after freedom come dey rents it out at $3.00 a acre to
raise 'taters in.


"Us live in shacks 'bout like dese 'round here. Dese times am better'n
slavery times, 'cause den you couldn't go nowheres 'thout de pass or de
patterrollers git you. Dat mean 25 lashes and more when you gits home.


"My missus took us chillen to de Baptis' church and de white preacher he
preach. De cullud folks could have church demselves iffen dey have de
manager of 'ligion to kinder preach. Course he couldn't read, he jus'
talk what he done heared de white preachers say.


"I git ship one time. Dat time de overseer give me de breakin'. Dey have
stocks dey put a man in. Dey put de man leg through de holes and shut it
down. De man jus' lay dere and bawl.


"De clothes us wore was shirts and us didn't git no britches till us
big. I's wearin' britches a good many year 'fore freedom, though. Dey
give us two suit de year and us have beefhide shoes what us call
moc'sins.


"Dey wasn't no better people dan my white folks. Dey didn't 'low us to
be brutalize', but dey didn't 'low us to be sassy, neither. I holp my
grandma milk de cows.


"When de Yankees come to New Orleans dey go on to Port Hudson and have
de big fight dere. Massa order everybody be ready to travel nex'
mornin'. Dey 'bout 300 peoples in dat travel wagon and dey camps dat
night at Camp Fusilier, where de 'federates have de camp. Dey make only
five mile dat day. Dey stops one night at Pin Hook, in Vermilionville.
My brudder die dere. Dey kep' on dat way till dey come to Trinity River.
I stay dere five year.


"De overseer on de new plantation name Smoot. I wait on de table and
grandma she cook for Smoot. Dey raise sugar cane and corn and peas and
sich like. Dey have lots of pork meat. Dey have stock and one time a
calf git eat by a panther. Massa hunt dat panther and shoot him in a
tree.


"One day Smoot tell me to bring all de hands to de house when dey blows
de horn at noon. When dey gits dere old massa say dey's free as he was.
If dey stays he say he give 'em half de crop, but didn't one stay. Six
or seven what wants go back to de old home massa done give teams to and
it take dem 'bout six week comin' home. I's glad to git dere. I couldn't
see free meant no better. Missus plantation seem mighty pleasant.


"I been marry twict. Fust time a gal name Celeste, but she 'fuse to come

John McCoy




*John McCoy, ex-slave, who lives in a small shack in the rear of 2310
State St., Houston, Texas, claims to have been born Jan. 1, 1838.
Although his memory is hazy, John is certain that "folks had a heap more
sense in slave times den dey has now."*


"Well, suh, my white folks done larn me to start de cotton row right and
point for de stake at de far end of de field, and dat way a nigger don't
git off de line and go dis-a-way and dat-a-way. He start right and end
right, yes, suh! Dat de way to live--you start right and go de straight
way to de end and you comes out all right.


"I's been here a mighty long time, I sho has, and done forgit a heap,
'cause my head ain't so good no more, but when I first knowed myself I
'longs to old Marse John McCoy. Old Miss Mary was he wife and dey de
only white folks what I ever 'longs to. Dat how come I's a McCoy, 'cause
all de niggers what old marse have goes by his name.


"My pappy's name was Hector and mammy's name Ann, and dey dies when I's
jes' a young buck and dat been a long time 'fore freedom. Ain't got no
brudders and sisters what I knows 'bout. All a slave have to go by am
what de white folks tells him 'bout his kinfolks.


"Old Marse John have a big place round Houston and raises cotton and
corn and hawgs and cows. Dere was lots of wilderness den, full of
varmints and wildcats and bears. Old Marse done larn me 'bedience and
not to lie or steal, and he larn me with de whip. Dat all de larnin' we
gits. Does he cotch you with de book or paper, he whip you hand down. He
don't whip de old folks none, jes' de young bucks, 'cause dey wild and
mean and dat de onlies' way dey larns right from wrong.


"I tells you jes' like I tells everyone--folks had heap more sense in
slave times dan dey has now. Long as a nigger do right, old marse
pertect him. Old Marse feed he niggers good, too, and we has plenty
clothes. Course, dey home-made on de spinnin' wheel, but dey good. De
shoes jes' like pen'tentiary shoes, only not fix up so good. Old Marse
kill a cow for meat and take de hide to de tanner and Uncle Jim make dat
hide into shoes. Dey hard and heavy and hurt de feets, but dey wear like
you has iron shoes.


"Old Marse don't work de niggers Sunday like some white folks do. Dat de
day we has church meetin' under trees. De spirit jes' come down out de
sky and you forgits all you troubles.


"Slave times was de best, 'cause cullud folks am ig'rant and ain't got
no sense and in slave times white folks show dem de right way. Now dey
is free, dey gits uppity and sassy. Some dese young bucks ought to git
dere heads whipped down. Dat larn dem manners.


"Freedom wasn't no diff'rence I knows of. I works for Marse John jes' de
same for a long time. He say one mornin, 'John, you can go out in de
field iffen you wants to, or you can git out iffen you wants to, 'cause
de gov'ment say you is free. If you wants to work I'll feed you and give
you clothes but can't pay you no money. I ain't got none.' Humph, I
didn't know nothin' what money was, nohow, but I knows I'll git plenty
victuals to eat so I stays till old marse die and old miss git shet of
de place. Den I gits me a job farmin' and when I gits too old for dat I
does dis and dat for white folks, like fixin' yards.


"I's black and jes' a poor, old nigger, but I rev'rence my white folks
'cause dey rared me up in de right way. If cullud folk pay 'tention and
listen to what de white folks tell dem, de world be a heap better off.
Us old niggers knows dat's de truth, too, 'cause we larns respec' and
manners from our white folks and on de great day of jedgment my white
folks is gwineter meet me and shake hands with me and be glad to see me.
Yes, suh, dat's de truth!"








Hap McQueen




*Hap McQueen, 80, was born in Tennessee, a slave of the McQueen family,
who later brought Hap to Texas. He now lives in Beaumont.*


"I's born in Tennessee but dey brings me 'way from dere when I's a
little chile, what my mammy say is eight year gwine on nine. My daddy

"We come from Tennessee in de fall in de wagons and it takes us a long

"Massa have three cook women and two was my grandma and my mammy. De

"Dey have a big house to take care de chillen when dey mammies workin'

herse'f every day to see dem and sometime play with dem.


"Massa son John was de overseer but de old massa wouldn't 'low him to
whip de slaves. Iffen it got to be done, old massa do it, but he never
draw blood like on de plantations 'round us. Some of dem on dose
plantations say dey ain't want Massa McQueen's niggers 'round de place,
'cause dey's free, dey fed too good and all, and dey afraid it make dere
slaves unsatisfy.


"Dey allus stop workin' Saturday afternoons and Sunday and gits pass to
go fishin' or huntin'. Sometime dey has preachin' under de arbor. Den at
dinner time dey blow de horn and de cullud folks eats at de same time as
de white folks, right where massa kin watch 'em, and if dey not enough
to eat, he say, 'How come? What de matter with de cooks?'


"He live in a two-story house builded out of lumber and all 'round in de
yard was de quarters. Dey make out of logs and most has a little patch
de massa 'lows 'em, and what dey raise dey own. My daddy raise cotton
each year and he raise sweet 'taters and bank 'em.


"Dey has Georgia hosses in de quarters. Dey was dem bed places what de
niggers slep' on. Dey bores holes in de wall of de house and makes de
frame of de bed and puts cotton mattress and quilt on dem. De white
folks have house make bedsteads, too. De first bought bed I see was a
plumb 'stonishment to me. It have big posties to hang 'skeeter bar over.
De chairs was homemake too, with de white oak splits for de bottoms.


"Massa he didn't go to de war, but he sent he oldest boy, call John. He
takes my daddy 'long to feed de stock and like dat. I goes to de camp

"I marry long time after freedom and raise' two batch of chillen. My
first wife have eight and my second wife have nine.


"I 'members de story 'bout de man what owned de monkey. Dat monkey, he
watch and try do everything a man do. One time a nigger make up he mind
scare 'nother nigger and when night time come, he put a white sheet over
him and sot out for de place dat nigger pass. De monkey he seed dat
nigger with de sheet and he grab de nice, white tablecloth and throw it

"So one day dat nigger shavin' and de monkey watchin' him. He know right

Bill McRay




*Bill McRay was born in Milam, fifteen miles north of San Augustine,
Texas, in 1851. He is a brother of C.B. McRay. Col. McRay was his owner
(the name may have been spelled McCray, Bill says). Bill now lives in
Jasper, Texas. He is said to be an expert cook, having cooked for
hotels, boats and military camps 40 years.*


"I was born in Milam in 1851 and dat makes me 86 year ole. My mother and
father was slaves and dey brung me to Jasper in 1854. Colonel McRay, he
was our marster and dis' our boss. He have 40 head of niggers, but he
never hit one of 'em a lick in his life. He own a big farm and have a
foreman named Bill Cummins. I stay with de Colonel till after I's free.


"Us have good marster, but some of de neighbors treat dere slaves rough.
Ole Dr. Neyland of Jasper, he have 75 or 80 slaves and he was rich and
hard on de slaves. One day two run away, Tom and Ike, and Dr. Neyland
takes de bloodhoun's and ketch dose two niggers and brung 'em in. One of
de niggers takes a club and knock one of de houn's in de head and kilt
him. Dey cook dat dog and make dem niggers eat part of him. Den dey give
both of 'em a beatin'.


"De ole log jail in Jasper, it useter stan' whar de Fish Store is now.
Dey have a place t'other side de jail whar dey whip niggers. De whippin'
pos' was a big log. Dey make de niggers lie down on it and strap 'em to
it. I was a lil' boy den and me and two white boys, Coley McRay and
Henry Munn, we useter slip 'round and watch 'em. Coley and Henry both
grow up and go to war but neither one come back.




[Illustration: _Bill McRay_]




"Sam Swan, he was sheriff, and he ketch two run-away niggers one day.
Dey was brudders and dey was name Rufe and John Grant. Well, he takes
'em and puts dem in jail and some of de men gits 'em out and takes 'em
down to de whippin' pos' and den strap 'em down and give 'em one
terrible lashin' and den throw salt in dere wounds and you could hear
dem niggers holler for a mile. Den dey took 'em back to de farm to wo'k.


"Dey hanged good many niggers 'round Jasper. In slavery times dey hangs
a nigger name Jim Henderson, at Mayhew Pond. Us boys wen' dere and mark
de tree. Two cullud men, Tom Jefferson and Sam Powell, dey kill anudder
nigger and dey hang dem to de ole white oak tree what is south of Jasper
Court House.


"After I's free I cooks for Cap'n Kelly in his mil'tary camps for 21
year. Den I cook for boats what run up and down de Neches and Angelina
rivers. I wants to say, too, dat I wo'ks for every sheriff in Jasper
County 'ceptin' de las' one. Guess I's too young to wo'k for him!"








C.B. McRay




*C.B. McRay was born in Jasper, Texas, in 1861, a slave to John H.
McRay, a slave trader. C.B. is rather unapproachable, and has a
secretive manner, as though he believes the human race will bear a
little watching. He told of only one wife, but his present wife
explained, confidentially, that he has had six. He lives in Jasper.*


"My name is C.B. McRay, better knowed as 'Co'nstalk', 'cause I's long
and thin. Also knowed as 'Racer', 'cause I useter be fleet on the feet.
When I's ten year ole I often caught a rabbit what jump 'fore me, jus'
by runnin' him down. Don' see why my boys can't do the same.


"I's bo'n in Jasper, on Main street, right where Lanier's Store stan's,
on the 12th of April, in 1861. My father's name was Calvin Bell McRay,
de same as mine, and mother's name was Harriet McRay. Father was bo'n in
Virginny and mother in Sabine County, in Texas. My brudders' names was
Bill McRay and Robert and Duckin Dacus. Father and mother was slaves
right here in Jasper, and so was my gran'parents, who was bo'n in
Africy.


"John McRay was us marster. He was call a 'nigger trader', and was sich
a easy marster dat other people call he slaves, 'McRay's free niggers'.
He make trips to New Orleans to buy slaves and brung 'em back and sol'
'em to de farmers. Missus was de bestes' white woman to cullud folks dat
ever live.


"I's too lil' to wo'k much but I 'member lotsa things. Us have a big
dinin'-room with a big, long table for de cullud folks and us git jus'
the same kin' of food dat the white folks have on dere table. Iffen a
nigger sass marster and he couldn' control him, he was de fus' one to be
sol' and git rid of. He sol' my uncle dat way. But marster was good to
us when we done right.


"The nigger women spinned and weaved cloth. I 'spec' dat's the onlies'
place in Jasper whar you could go any time of day and see a parlor full
of nigger women, sittin' up dere fat as dey could be and with lil' to
do. Marster have no plantation for de men to wo'k but he rented lan' for
them to cult'vate.


"Marster's niggers all got Sunday clothes and shoes. Every one of dem
have to dress and come to the parlor so he could look dem over 'fore dey
goes to church.


"Us have a foreman, name Charlie. It was his duty to keep de place
stock' with wood. He take slaves and wo'k de wood patches when it
needed, but onct marster come home from New Orleans and foun' dem all
sufferin' for want of fire. He call ole Charlie and ask him why he not
git up plenty wood. 'Well,' old Charlie say, 'wood was short and 'fore I
could git more dis col' spell come and it too awful col' to git wood.'
Marster say, 'You keep plenty wood or I gwinter sell you to a mean
marster.' Charlie git better for a while, then he let wood git low
again. So he was sol' to Ballard Adams, who had the name of bein' hard
on his slaves. Charlie couldn' do enough wo'k to suit Marster Adams, so
he put him in what's knowed as the 'Louisiana shirt.' Dat was a barrel
with a hole cut in the bottom jus' big enough for Charlie to slip he
head through. Dey pull dis on to him every mornin' and then he couldn'
sit down or use he arms, coul' jus' walk 'roun' all day, de brunt of
other slaves' jokes. At night dey took it off and chain him to he bed.
After he have wo'n dis Louisiana shirt a month de marster task he again.
He fail and run off to the woods. So Marster Adams, he come to Marster
McRay and want to sell Charlie back again, but he couldn', 'cause
freedom jus' come and they couldn' sell slaves no more, but Marster
McRay say Charlie coul' come back and stay on he place if he wanted to.

"Dey didn' try to teach us readin' and writin', but Miss Mary read de
Bible to us every Sunday. Iffen us git sick dey git ol Dr. Haynes or Dr.
Perkins.


"When us chillun, we plays 'Town Ball' and marbles. Mother's fav'rite
lullaby was Bye-o Baby Buntin'.


"I never seed any sojers till after de War close, den I seed dem camp on
Court House Square right here in Jasper. When freedom was 'clared, Miss
Mary call us niggers into the parlor and den Marster McRay come and tol'
us we's free. He 'vise 'em to wo'k 'round Jasper, whar they knows
people, and says iffen any wan's to stay with him to please rise up.
Every person riz up. So dey all stay with him for a time. After 'while
he 'gin to rent and cult'vate differen' plantation, and dere treatment
not so good, so dey 'gin to be dissatisy and pull loose."








Julia Malone




*Julia Malone, 79, was born a slave of Judge Ellison, who owned a
thousand acre plantation near Lockhart, Texas. Julia's mother was killed
by another slave. Julia stayed with the Ellison family several years
after she was freed. She lives at 305 Percy St., Fort Worth, Texas.*


"Jedge Ellison owned 'bout a tousand acres land near Lockhart, a few
miles up de Clear Fork river. Right dere I is borned, and it were a big
place and so many goin' and comin' it look like de beehive. De buildin's
and sheds look like de li'l town.


"I 'member bein' left in de nursery whilst my mammy work in de fields.
One night she go to de river for to wash clothes. She has to wash after
dark and so she am washin' and a nigger slave sneak up on her and hit
her on de neck, and it am de death of her. So de woman what mammy allus
live with takes care of me den and when freedom came she moves to town,
but massa won't let her took me. I stays on with him and runs errands,
while I is not fannin' de new baby. Dey has six while I'm dere. I fans
dem till I drops asleep, and dat call for de whippin'.


"My foster mammy comes out and asks massa to let her have me, but he
won't do dat. But she puts one over on him fin'ly and gits me anyway. He
am gone and missus am gone and I has to stay home alone with de last
baby, and a man and woman what was slaves on de place 'fore surrender,
comes by in a wagon and tells me to jump in. Dey takes me to my foster
mammy and she moves and won't 'low me outside, so massa can't ever find
me.


"She 'splains lots of things to me. I done see de women stick dere heads
in de washpot and talk out loud, while us in slavery. She tells me day
prayin' for de Lawd to take dem out from bondage. Dey think it right to
pray out loud so de Lawd can hear but dey mustn't let de massa hear dem.


"I asks her 'bout my father and she says him on de place but die 'fore
I's borned. He was make de husband to lots of women on de place, 'cause
he de big man.


"She am good to me and care for me till I meets de boy I likes. Us lives
together for fifteen years and den him dies. My chillen is all dead. He
name am William Emerson and I waits nine years 'fore I marries 'gain.
Den I marries Albert Malone and I's lucky 'gain. He's de good man. One
day he am fixin' de sills under de house and de whole house moves over
and falls on him. I feels so grievous over dat I never marries 'gain.
Dat thirty-four year ago, and I lives alone all de time. It ain't 'cause
I doesn't have de chance, 'cause lots of bucks wants me, 'cause I's de
hard worker.


"I washes for de livin' and washes old massa's daughter's clothes. Massa
am de powerful man durin' slavery and have de money and fine clothes and
drives de fine teams and acts like de cock of de walk. All dat changes
after freedom. I seed him layin' in de sun like de dog. I offers to wash
he clothes and he jus' grunt. He done turned stone deaf, and de white
folks say it 'cause he done treat he slaves so bad.


"I done live here in Fort Worth 'bout fifteen years with my daughter,
Beulah Watkins. I's mighty happy here, and has de $10.00 pension and
thanks de Lawd fer dat."








Adeline Marshall




*Adeline Marshall, 3514 Bastrop St., Houston, Texas, was born a slave
somewhere in South Carolina. She was bought by Capt. Brevard and brought
to Texas while still a baby, so she remembers nothing about her family
and has no record of her age. Adeline is evidently very old.*


"Yes, suh, Adeline Marshall am my name, all right, but folks 'round here
jes' calls me 'Grandma.'


"Lawd have mercy, I's been in dis here land too long, too long, and jes'
ain't no 'count no more for nothin'. I got mis'ries in my bones and jes'
look at what I's got on my feet! Dem's jes' rags, dat's all, rags. Can't
wear nothin' else on 'em, dey hurts so. Dat's what de red russet shoes
what we wears in slave times done--jes' pizen de feets.


"Lawd, Lawd, dat sho' bad times--black folks jes' raise up like cattle
in de stable, only Cap'n Brevard, he what own me, treats he hosses and
cattle better'n he do he niggers.


"Don't know nothin' 'bout myself, 'cept on Cap'n Brevard's place down on
Oyster Creek. He has de plantation dere, what de only place I knows till
I's freedomed. He says I's a South Carolina nigger what he bought back
dere and brung to Texas when I jes' a baby. I reckon it de truth, 'cause
I ain't never knowed no mama or papa, neither one.


"Cap'n he a bad man, and he drivers hard, too, all de time whippin' and
stroppin' de niggers to make dem work harder. Didn't make no difference
to Cap'n how little you is, you goes out to de field mos' soon's you can
walk. De drivers don't use de bullwhip on de little niggers, but dey
plays de switch on us what sting de hide plenty. Sometimes dey puts a
nigger in de stocks and leaves dem two or three days, don't give dem
nothin' to eat or a drink of water, jes' leaves dem till dey mos' dead.
Does dey die, jes' put dem in a box and dig a hole out back of de hoss
lot and dump dem in and cover up. Ain't no preachin' service or nothin',
but de poor nigger out he mis'ry, dat's all.


"Old Cap'n jes' hard on he niggers and I 'member one time dey strops old
Beans what's so old he can't work good no more, and in de mornin' dey
finds him hangin' from a tree back of de quarters. He done hang himself
to 'scape he mis'ry!


"We works every day 'cept Sunday and has to do our washin' den. Does
anybody git sick week days, he has to work Sunday to make it up. When we
comes in at night we has to go right to bed. Dey don't 'low no light in
de quarters and you better be in bed if you don't want a whippin'.


"We gits a plain cotton slip with a string 'round de neck, de stuff dey
makes pickin' sacks of. Summer or winter, dat all we gits to wear.


"Old Cap'n have a big house but I jes' see it from de quarters, 'cause
we wasn't 'lowed to go up in de yard. I hear say he don't have no wife,
but a black woman what stays at de house. Dat de reason so many 'No
Nation' niggers 'round. Some calls dem 'Bright' niggers, but I calls dem
'No Nation' 'cause dat what dey is, ain't all black or all white, but
mix. Dat come from slave times.


"I knows I's good size when Old Cap'n calls us in and say we's free, but
nobody tell me how old I is and I never found out. I knows some of us
stays and works for somethin' to eat, 'cause we didn't know no one and
didn't hab nowheres to go.


"Den one day, Cap'n come out in de field with 'nother man and pick me
and four more what's workin' and say we's good workers. Dat was Mr. Jack
Adams, what have a place clost to Stafford's Run. He say if we wants to
work on his place he feed us and give quarters and pay us for workin',
and dat how come I leaves old Cap'n, and I ain't never see him or dat
place where I's raise sence, but I reckon he so mean de debbil done got
him in torment long time ago.


"I works in de field for Mr. Jack and dat where Wes Marshall, what I
marries, works, too. After we gits married we gits a piece of ground and
stays on de same place till Mr. Jack die and we come to Houston. Dat
'fore de 1900 storm.


"I tells folks when dat storm comin'. I ain't 'lieve in no witch doin's,
but some way I knows when dat storm comin'. Dey laughs at dis old
nigger, but it come and dey loses hosses and cattle and chickens and
houses.


"I tells de truth jes' like it am, and I's had a hard time in de land.
Why, in dis sinful town, dey don't do like de Good Book say. No, suh,
dey don't. It say, 'Love thy neighbor,' and folks don't love nobody but
theyselves!


"Jes' look at me! I's old with mis'ry and 'lone in de world. My husband
and chillen done die long ago and leave me here, and I jes' go from
house to house, tryin' to find a place to stay. Dat why I prays Gawd to
take me to his bosom, 'cause He de onlies' one I got to call on."








Isaac Martin




*Quite black, with close-cut hair and stubby gray whiskers, Isaac Martin
is contentedly spending the evening of his life. But two or three
darkened teeth show between his thick lips as he talks. He was enjoying
the friendly shade of the old tree in his backyard from his comfortable
seat in an old rocker. His feet were bare and his once striped trousers
were rolled up above his knees to keep him cool in the hot midsummer
weather. Beside the chair was a pair of brogan shoes with gaping splits
across the toes to avoid cramping his feet. He told the story of by-gone
days with evident enjoyment.*


"Dis ol' man jes' layin' 'roun'. Ain't nuttin' to him no mo'. I done wo'
out. I jes' waitin' for de Good Marster to call po' ol' Isaac home to
Glory.


"When dey read de proclamation to my mammy and daddy dey mek 'em give
eb'rybody' age in de fam'ly. I was twelve year' ol' den.


"I was bo'n up here in Montgomery county 'bout t'ree mile from Willis
upon de I&GN Railroad. I holp to buil' dat I&GN Railroad.


"Ol' Major Wood he my daddy' marster, and 'course he mine too. He was
well fixed. He had 'bout seb'nty or eighty wukkin' slaves and I dunno
how many li'l niggers. I didn' know nuttin' 'bout ol' Missus, Mrs. Wood.
I jis' 'member she a big fat woman. Dey didn' 'low no li'l nigger
chillun up in de yard 'roun' de big house 'cep'n' to clean up de yard,
and dem what done dat, dey hatter be jis' like dat yard, clean as
peckerwoods.


"Ol' marster he warn't mean. He nebber whip' 'em jis' so iffen anybody
say de slave orter be whip. Dey hafter see him and tell him what dey
done befo' he give de order to de overseer to whip. Iffen he don' t'ink
dey orter be whip, he say don' whip 'em and dey don' git whip.


"I had to mind de cows and de sheep. I had a mule to ride 'roun' on. It
was dis way, I hafter mind de cows. Ol' marster he plant dif'rent fiel's
in co'n, fifty or sixty or a hundred acres. When dey harvestin' de co'n,
when dey git one fiel' done dey tu'n de cows in so dey kin eat on de
stalks and nubbins what lef' in dat fiel'. I got to ride 'roun' and see
de cows don' bus' over from one fiel' what dey done harves' into de
other fiel' where dey wukkin', or what ain't been harves' yet. I jis'
like dat, ridin' dat mule 'roun' de fiel' and keepin' de cows in.


"Den dere was five or six of us boys to keep de dogs out de sheep. You
know iffen de dogs git in de sheep dey ap' to kill 'em.


"Us go huntin' wid de dogs lots of time, and lots of time us ketch
rabbits. Dey was six dogs, and de rabbits we kotch was so much vittles
for us. I 'member one night us went out huntin' and ketch fo' or five
rabbits. Us tek 'em home and clean and dress 'em, and put 'em in de pot
to have big rabbit supper. I was puttin' some red pepper in de pot to
season 'em, and den I rub my eyes wid my han' and git dat pepper in my
eyes and it sho' burn. You know how red pepper burn when it git in your
eyes, I nebber will forgit 'bout dat red pepper. De ol' folks uster show
us how to fix de t'ings we ketch huntin', and cook 'em.


"Ol' marster sho' t'ought mo' of his li'l nigger chillen. He uster ride
in de quarters 'cause he like to see 'em come runnin'. De cook, she was
a ol' woman name' Forney, and she had to see atter feedin' de chillen.
She had a way of callin' 'em up. She holler, 'Tee, tee, t-e-e;' and all
us li'l niggers jis' come runnin'. Ol' marster he ride up and say,
'Forney, call up dem li'l pickaninnies,' and ol' Forney she lif' up her
voice and holler, 'Tee, t-e-e, t-e-e,' and ol' marster jis' set up on de
hoss and laugh and laugh a lot to see us come runnin' up. He like to
count how many li'l niggers he did have. Dat was fun for us too. I
'member dat jes' like yestiddy.


"Nuttin' went hard wid me. Fur's I know 'bout slav'ry dem was good
times.


"Dey had 'bout t'ree or fo' hundred of sheep. My father hafter kill a
mutton eb'ry Friday for de house. Dey bring up de sheep and somebody
hol' de head 'cross a block and my father cut de head off wid a hatchet.
Sheeps is de pitifullest t'ings to kill. Day jis' give up. And dey
cries, too. But a goat, he don' give up, naw suh, he talk' back to you
to de las'.


"I 'member one time dey gwine to give a school feas', and dey gwine kill
a goat. Dey hang dat goat up to a tree by he hind legs so de blood dreen
good. Dey cut he t'roat, dat's de way dey gwine kill 'im. Dat goat seem
like he kep' on talkin' and sayin' 'Please, God, don' kill me' to de
las', but dat ain't done no good. Dat goat jis' beg to de las'.


"My ol' marster he live in a big house. Oh, it was a palace. It had
eight or nine rooms. It was buil' outer logs, and moss and clay was
stuff' twixt de logs. Dere was boards on de outside and it was all coil'
nice on de inside. He lived in a mansion.


"Dey was plenty rich. Ol' marster he had a ol' waitin' man all dress up
nice and clean. Now if you wanter talk to ol' marster you hafter call
for dat ol' waitin' man. He come and you tell him what you want and den
he go and tell ol' marster and den he say, 'Bring him in,' and den you
go in and see de ol' marster and talk your business, but you had to be
nice and hol' your hat under your arm.


"Dey's big rich people. Sometime' dey have parties what las' a week. Dey
was havin' dere fun in dere way. Dey come in kerridges and hacks.


"My father was de hostler and he hafter keep de hosses and see 'bout
feedin' 'em. Dey had a sep'rate li'l house for de saddles. Ol' marster
he kep' good hosses. He warn't mean.


"He had a great big pasture and lots of times people go camp in it. You
see it was dis-away, de Yankees dey got rushin' de American people, dat
de Confed'rates, dey kep' comin' furder and furder wes', 'till dey come
to Texas and den dey can't go much furder. De Yankees kep' crowdin' 'em
and dey kep' on comin'. When dey camp in ol' marster' pasture, he give
'em co'n. I see 'em dribe a whole wagon load of co'n and dump it on de
groun' for dey hosses. De Yankees nebber come 'till de war close. Den
dey come all through dat country. Dat was destruction, it seem to me
like. Dey take what dey want.


"When freedom come and de proclamation was read and de ol' marster tol'
'em dey was free and didn' have no ol' marster no mo' some of de slaves
cried. He tell 'em, 'I don't want none of you to leave. I'll give you
$8.00 a mont'.' All de ol' folks stay and help gadder dat crop. It sho'
griebe ol' marster and he didn' live long atter dey tek his slaves 'way
from him. Well, it jis' kill' him, dat's all. I 'members de Yankees on
dat day dey sot to read de proclamation. Dey was gwine 'roun' in dey
blue uniform' and a big long sword hangin' at dey side. Dat was
cur'osity to dem niggers.


"When ol' marster want to go out, he call he li'l nigger serbent to go
tell my father what was de hostler, to saddle up de hoss and bring him
'roun'. Den ol marster git on him. He had t'ree steps, so he could jis'
go up dem steps and den his foot be right at de stirrup. My daddy hol'
de stirrup for him to put he other foot in it.


"I was big 'nuff to run after him and ax him to gimme a dime. He laugh
and sometime he gimme de dime. Sometime he pitch it to me and I run and
grab it up and say, 'T'ankee, marster,' and he laugh and laugh.


"Ol' mistus she had a reg'lar cook. Dat was my mudder's mudder.
Eb'ryt'ing had to be jis' so, and eb'ryt'ing nice and clean.


"Dey didn' do no reg'lar wuk on Sunday. Eb'ry Sunday one of de other
wimmins hafter tek de place of de cook so she could git off. All of 'em
what could would git off and go to de chu'ch for de preachin'. Dem what
turn didn' come one Sunday, would go anudder 'till dey all got 'roun' to
go.


"Marster had two or t'ree hundred head of cattle. My gran'father,
Guilford, had a mule and hoss of he own. Uncle Hank was his brudder, and
he had de sheep department to look attar. Sometime de niggers git a hoss
or a sheep over, den de marster buy 'im. Some of de niggers had a li'l
patch 'roun' dey cabin' and dey raise veg'table. Ol' marster he buy de
veg'table sometime. I didn' know what freedom was. I didn' know wedder I
needed it or not. Seem to me like it was better den dan now, 'cause I
gotter look out for myself now.


"Us uster be on de watch-out for ol' marster. De fus' one see him comin'
lit out and open de gate for him to ride froo and ol' marster toss him a
nickle.


"When it was time to eat, de ol' cook she holler out, 'T-e-e, t-e-e,
t-e-e-e' and all us li'l niggers come runnin'. She have a big tray and
each of us have a wessel and a spoon. She fill' us wessel and us go eat
and den us go back for mo'. Us git all us want. Dey give us supper befo'
de han's come in from de fiel' and what wid playin' 'roun' all day and
eatin' all us could hol' in de afternoon, twarn't long befo' us li'l
niggers ready to go to sleep.


"One t'ing, ol' marster didn' want his niggers to run about. Sometime
dey want to go over to anudder plantation on Sunday. Den he give 'em a
pass iffen he willin' for 'em to go. Dey had patterrollers to ride from
plantation to see iffen dey was any strange niggers dere.


"When dey wanter marry, de man he repo't to ol' marster. He want his
niggers to marry on his own plantation. He give 'em a nice li'l supper
and a big dance. Dey had some sort of license but ol' marster tek care
of dat. He had two sons what had farms and slaves of dere own. Ol'
marster didn' care if his slaves marry on his sons' farms. If any of de
slaves do mean, he mak 'em work on Sunday. He didn' b'leeb in beatin'
'em.


"So many of 'em as could, usually go to de white folks chu'ch on Sunday
and hear de white preacher. Dey sit off to deyse'fs in de back of de
chu'ch. Dem what stay at home have a cullud preacher. Dey try to raise
'em up social.


"Dey had a ol' woman to look after de babies when dey mammies was out in
de fiel'. Dey have a time sot for de mammies te come in and nuss de
babies. De ol' woman she had helpers. Dey had a big house and cradle'
for dem babies where de nuss tek care of 'em.


"When anybody die dey have a fun'rel. All de han's knock off work to
'tend de fun'rel. Dey bury de dead in a ho'made coffin.


"I nebber pay no 'tenshun to talk 'bout ghos'es. I nebber b'leeb in 'em.
But one time comin' from chu'ch my uncle' wife say, 'Ike, you eber see a
ghos'? Want to see one?' and I tell her 'I don't give a cent, yes I want
to see one.' She say, 'I show you a man dress' all in white what ain't
got no head, and you gwine feel a warm breeze.' After a while down de
hill by de graveyard she say, 'Dere he go.' I look' but I neber see
nuttin', but I feel de warm breeze.


"I uster go to see a gal and I uster hafter pass right by a ol'
graveyard. It was all wall' up wid brick but one place dey had steps up
over de wall so when dey hafter bury a body two men kin walk up dem
steps side by side, and dat de way dey tek de corpse over. Well, when I
git to dem steps I hear sump'n'. Den I stop and I ain't hear nuttin'.
When I start walkin' ag'in I hear de noise ag'in. I look 'roun' and den
I see sump'n' white come up right dere where de steps go over de wall. I
had a stick in my han' and nex' time it come up I mek a rush at it and
hit it. It was jis' a great big ol' billy goat what got inside de wall
and was tryin' to git out. He get out jis' when I hit him and he lit out
froo de woods. Dat's de only ghos' I eber see and I's glad dat warn't no
ghos'.


"Ol' marster he had twenty head of cows. Dey give plenty milk. Dey uster
git a cedar tub big as dat dere one full of milk. De milkers dey pack it
en dey head to de house. Us cow-pen boys had to go drive up de caffs.
Cow-pen boys? Cow-pen boys, dem de boys what keep away de caffs when dey
do de milkin'. Co'se, lots of times when dey froo milkin' us jump on 'em
and ride 'em. Wheneber dey ketch us doin' dat dey sho' wear us out. Dat
warn't yestiddy.


"Fur as I's concern we had a plum good time in slav'ry. Many a year my
grampa raise a bale of cotton and marster buy it. Dat was encouragin' us
to be smart.


"My daddy name' Edmond Wood and my ma name' Maria. I had a brudder and a
sister; dey name' Cass and Ann. I been a farmer all my life. I kep' on
farmin' 'till de boll weevil hit dese parts and den I quit de farm and
went to public work. I work in de woods and cut logs. I buy dis house. I
been here 'roun' Voth 'bout twenty-five year'.


"I been marry twict. De fus' time I marry--I git so stinkin' ol' I can't
'member when it were, but it been a long ways back. My fus' wife, Mary
Johnson. She die' and den I marry dis yere woman I got yere now. Her
name been Rhoda McGowan when I marry her but she been marry befo'. Befo'
of us ol', ain't fit fer nuttin'. Us git pension' and dat what us live
on now, 'cause I too ol' to do any work no mo'.


"Me and my fus' wife we had ten chillun. Dey's all dead but fo' and I
ain't sho' dey's all livin'. Las' I heerd of 'em one was in Houston, and
one in Chicago, and one in Kansas City, and one live here. I see him dis
mawnin'.


"I heerd tell of de Klu Klux but I ain't neber seed 'em. I neber did go
to school needer.


"I's a member of de C.M.E. Meth'dis' Chu'ch. When I uster could git
about I uster be a steward in de chu'ch. Den I was de treasurer of de
chu'ch here at Voth for some seben year'. I uster b'long to de U.B.F.
Lodge, too.


"Back in slav'ry dey allus had a ol' darky to train de young ones and
teach 'em right from wrong. And dey'd whip you for doin' wrong. Dey'd
repo't to de overseer. Some of 'em was mean and repo't somebody dey
ain't like jis' to git 'em in trouble. De overseer he had to 'vestigate
'bout it and if it was so, somebody git a whippin'. Sometimes some folks
repo't sump'n' when it warn't true.


"Ol' marster he was plum ind'pendant. His plantation was off from de
town. He uster had his mail brung to him. Fur's I kin 'member I didn'
had to look out for nuttin'. Dey had a time to call all de slaves up and
give 'em hats, and anudder time dey give 'em shoes, and anudder time dey
give 'em clo's. Dey see dat eb'rybody was fit. Ol' marster allus give
'em all some kinder present at Crismus. I dunno what all he give de ol'
folks but he give de chillun candy and de like.


"I was allus tickle' to see ol' marster come 'roun'--Oh, good gracious,
yes. And it allus tickle' him to come 'roun' and see all his li'l
niggers.


"One time Cap'n Fisher was 'sociated wid ol' marster, and him and
anudder man come 'long wid ol' marster up de road what run froo de
quarters. Dey wanter see de li'l niggers. Ol' marster call 'em up and
frow out a han'ful of dimes. It sho' tickle' 'em te see de li'l niggers
scramble for dem dimes, and us look' for dimes 'roun' dat place for a
week. Dat was enjoyment to de white folks dem days.


"Marster was good to his niggers and none of 'em eber run away. My
mudder she raise ol' mistus' baby chile. She uster suckle him jis' like
he her own baby and he allus t'ink lots of her. After he a growed up man
he uster bring her presents lots of times. He call her 'mammy' all de
time.


"He went off to de war. He los' he hearin' and got deef. Muster been de
noise from dem big cannons what done it. He got his big toe shot off in
de war, too. After de war was over he come home and git married.


"Dat 'bout all dat I kin 'member 'cep'n' dat I vote' in de state and
other 'lections when I's twenty-one year' ol'."








James Martin




*James Martin, 311 Dawson St., San Antonio, Texas, is 90 years old. His
parents were Preston and Lizzie Martin and he was born in Alexandria,
Va. Uses little dialect.*


"I was born in Virginia in 1847. My mother was a slave and my
grandfather was one of the early settlers in Virginia. He was born in
Jamaica and his master took him to England. When the English came to
Virginia, they brought us along as servants, but when they got here,
everybody had slaves, so we was slaves, too. My mother was born in the
West Indies.


"A man named Martin brought my grandfather here and we took his name.
And when marster was ready to die, he made a will and it said the
youngest child in the slaves must be made free, so that was my father
and he was made free when he was 16. That left me and my brothers and
sisters all free, but all the rest of the family was slaves.


"My mother was born a slave near Alexandria. The marster's daughter,
Miss Liza, read to my mother, so she got some learning. When my mother's
owner died he left her to Miss Liza, and then my father met my mother
and told her they should get married. My mother said to Miss Liza: 'I'd
like fine to marry Preston Martin.' Miss Liza says, 'You can't do that,
'cause he's a free nigger and your children would be free. You gotta
marry one of the slaves.' Then Miss Liza lines up 10 or 15 of the slave
men for my mother to pick from, but mother says she don' like any of
'em, she wants to marry Preston Martin. Miss Liza argues but my mother
is just stubborn, so Miss Liza says, 'I'll talk to the marster.' He
says, 'I can't lose property like that, and if you can raise $1,200 you
can buy yourse'f free.' So my mother and my father saves money and it
takes a long time, but one day they goes to the marster and lays down
the money, and they gits married. Marster don' like it, but he's
promised and he can't back out.


"So me and my brothers and sisters is free. And we sees others sol' on
the auction block. They're put in stalls like pens for cattle and
there's a curtain, sometimes just a sheet in front of them, so the
bidders can't see the stock too soon. The overseer's standin' just
outside with a big black snake whip and a pepper box pistol in his hand.
Then they pulls the curtain up and the bidders crowds 'round. The
overseer tells the age of the slaves and what they can do. One bidder
takes a pair of white gloves they have and rubs his fingers over a man's
teeth, and he says, 'You say this buck's 20 years old, but there's cups
worn to his teeth. He's 40 years if he's a day. So they knock that buck
down for $1,000, 'cause they calls the men 'bucks' and the women
'wenches.' Then the overseer makes 'em walk across the platform, he
makes 'em hop, he makes 'em trot, he makes 'em jump.


"When I'm old enough, I'm taught to be a saddler and when I'm 17 or 18 I
enlist in the Confed'rate Army.


"Did they whip the slaves? Well, they jus' about half killed 'em. When
it was too rough, they slipped into Canada.


"A marriage was a event. The bride and groom had to jump over a broom
handle. The boss man had a white preacher, sometimes, and there was
plenty good beef cornbread. But if the boss didn't care much, he jus'
lined 'em up and said, 'Mandy, that's your husband and, Rufus, that's
your wife.'

"After the war we were sent to Texas, the 9th U.S. Cavalry, under Capt.
Francis F. Dodge. I was at Fort Sill, Fort Davis, Fort Stockton and Fort
Clark. I was in two battles with Indians in the Guadalupe Mountains. I
served under Col. Shafter in 1871 and I got my discharge under Gen.
Merritt in 1872. Then I come to San Antonio.


"I helped bring the first railroad here. The S.P. in them days only ran
near Seguin and I was a spiker and worked the whole distance. Then I
helped build the old railroad from Indianola to Cuero and then from
Cuero to Corpus, and Schleister, I think, and Cunningham were the
contractors. That was in 1873 and 1874.


"I drove cattle for big outfits, and drove 2,000 or 3,000 head from
South Texas sometimes clean up to Dakota. I drove for John Lytle,
Brockhaus, Kieran and Bill Sutton. There wasn't no trails and no fences.
The Indians would come ask for meat and we knew if we didn't give it to
'em they'd stampede the cattle.


"If I wasn't so old, I'd travel 'round again. I don't believe any man
can be educated who ain't traveled some."








Louise Mathews




*Louise Mathews, 83, is a sister of Scott Hooper. Her owner was the Rev.
Robert Turner. Louise married Henry Daggett when she was twenty, Jim
Byers when she was thirty-one and Bill Mathews when she was
thirty-three. She lives alone at 2718 Ennis Ave., Fort Worth, about a
block from Scott.*


"Sho', I 'members dem slavery times, 'cause I's eleven when de break-up
come. Everybody call my massa Jedge Turner, but him am a Baptist
preacher and have de small farm and gen'ral store. My pappy and mammy
don't live together, 'cause pappy am own by Massa Jack Hooper. Massa
Turner done marry dem. Mostest de cullud folks jus' lives together by
'greement den, but massa have de cer'mony.


"Us live in log cabins with de dirt floor and no windows, and sleep on
straw ticks. All de cookin' done in de eatin' shed but when pappy come
over twict de week, mammy cooks him de meal den.


"Let me tell yous how de young'uns cared for. Massa give dem special
care, with de food and lots of clabber and milk and pot-liquor, and dey
all fat and healthy.


"Massa am a preacher and a farmer and a saloonkeeper. He makes de
medicine with whiskey and cherry bark and rust offen nails. It mus' be
good, 'cause us all fat and sassy. Gosh for 'mighty. How I hates to take
dat medicine! He say to me, 'Take good care de young'uns, 'cause de old
ones gwine play out sometime, and I wants de young'uns to grow strong.'


"Massa Turner wants de good day's work and us all give it to him. Every
Saturday night us git de pass if us wants to go to de party. Us have
parties and dancin' de quadrille and fiddles and banjoes.


"On Sunday massa preach to us, 'cause he de preacher heself. He preach
to de white folks, too.


"I 'member dat surrender day. He call us round him. I can see him now,
like I watches him come to de yard, with he hands clasp 'hind him and he
head bowed. I know what he says, 'I likes every one of you. You been
faithful but I has to give you up. I hates to do it, not 'cause I don't
want to free you, but 'cause I don't want to lose you all.' Us see de
tears in he eyes.




[Illustration: _Louise Mathews_]




"Mos' everybody leaves, and us go to pappy's place, den comes here in
1872, right here where us live now. My sister, Scott, she lives up de
street. It warn't no houses here den.


"I gits married in 1874 to Henry Daggett and he dies in 1884. Den I
marries Jim Byers in 1885 and he am lazy and no 'count. He leaves on
Christmas Day in de mornin', and don't come back. Dat de only present he
ever give me! He am what you calls de buck passer. I does de washin' and
ironin' and he passes de bucks I makes. I marries Bill Mathews and he my
las' husband. He dies on May 15th, dis year. I has seven chillen and
four of dem am right in dis town.


"I never votes but once, 'bout four years ago. I jus' don't care 'bout
it. Too much fustin' round for me. My husband allus voted de Lincoln
ticket.


"I gits 'round and it won't be long 'fore I goes to de Lawd's restin'
place. My sister am 81 and I's 83, and she lives in de next block yonder
way. Us am de cons'lation to each other."








William Mathews




*William Mathews, 89, was born a slave on the Adams plantation, in
Franklin Parish, Louisiana. He was driver of the family carriage. After
William was freed he supported himself by hiring out as a field hand and
by making and selling baskets. Since 1931 he has lived with his
daughter, Sarah Colburn, at 812-1/2 41st St., Galveston, Texas.*


"Course I can 'lect 'bout slavery. I is old and my eyesight am gone, but
I can still 'lect. I ain't never forgit it.


"My massa, old Buck Adams, could out-mean de debbil heself. He sho'
hard--hard and sneaky as slippery ellum. Old Mary Adams, he wife, was
'most as hard as he was. Sometimes I used to wonder how dere chillen
ever stood 'em. Old Buck Adams brung my mammy and daddy from South
Car'lina to work in de fields and my daddy's name was Economy Mathews
and my mammy's name Phoebe. Simmons was her name 'fore she marry. I is
born on old Buck's place, on December 25th, in 1848. Dat plantation was
in Franklin Parish, somewhere round Monroe, in Louisiana.


"Me and Bill Adams raised together. When he shoot a deer I run home like
greased lightnin' and git de hoss. Sometimes he'd shoot a big hawg and
I'd skin him.


"When I got big 'nough I'd drive dere carriage. I was what dey calls de
'waitin' boy.' I sot in dat buggy and wait till dey come out of where
dey was, and den driv 'em off. I wasn't 'lowed to git out and visit
round with de other slaves. No, suh, I had to set dere and wait.


"De slaves git out in de fields 'fore sun-up and work till black dark.
Den dey come home and have to feel dere way in de house, with no light.
My mammy and daddy field hands. My grandma was cook, and have to git in
de cook pot 'bout four o'clock to git breakfas' by daylight. Dey et by
candles or pine torches. One de black boys stand behin' 'em and hold it
while dey et.


"De clothes we wore was made out of dyed 'lows.' Dat de stuff dey makes
sackin' out of. Summer time us go barefoot but winter time come, dey
give you shoes with heels on 'em big as biscuits.


"De quarters is back of de big house and didn't have no floors. Dey sot
plumb on de ground and build like a hawg pen. Dey cut down timber and
stake it up at de corners and fill it in with timber with de bark on it.
Dere was split log houses and round log houses and all sech like dat.
Dey have only fifty slaves on dat place, and it a big place, big 'nough
for a hundred. But what dey do? Dey take de good slaves and sell 'em.
Dat what dey do. Den dey make de ones what am left do all de work. Sell,
sell, all de time, and never buy nobody. Dat was dem.


"Every Sat'day evenin' us go to de pitcher poke. Dat what dey calls it
when dey issues de rations. You go to de smokehouse and dey weigh out
some big, thick rounds of white pork meat and give it to you. De syrup
weighed out. De meal weighed out. Dey never give us no sugar or coffee.
You want coffee, you put de skillet on de fire and put de meal in it and
parch it till it most black, and put water on it. Mammy make salt water
bread out of a li'l flour and salt and water.


"Sometimes, dey make de slaves go to church. De white folks sot up fine
in dere carriage and drive up to de door and git de slaves out of one
cabin, den git de slaves out of de nex' cabin, and keep it up till dey
gits dem all. Den all de slaves walks front de carriage till dey gits to
church. De slaves sit outside under de shade trees. If de preacher talk
real loud, you can hear him out de window.


"If a cullud man take de notion to preach, he couldn't preach 'bout de
Gospel. Dey didn't 'low him do dat. All he could preach 'bout was obey
de massa, obey de overseer, obey dis, obey dat. Dey didn't make no
passel of fuss 'bout prayin' den. Sometimes dey have prayin' meetin' in
a cabin at night. Each one bring de pot and put dere head in it to keep
de echoes from gittin' back. Den dey pray in de pot. Dat de Gawd's
truth!


"Like I done said, massa sol' de good slaves in Monroe. Nobody marry in
dem days. A gal go out and take de notion for some buck and dey make de
'greement to live together. Course, if a unhealthy buck take up with a
portly gal, de white folks sep'rate 'em. If a man a big, stout man, good
breed, dey gives him four, five women.


"Sometimes dey run 'way. It ain't done dem no good, for de dawgs am put
on dey trail. If you climb de tree, dem dogs hold you dere till de white
folks comes, and den dey let de dogs git you. Sometimes de dogs tore all
dey clothes off, and dey ain't got nary a rag on 'em when dey git home.
If dey run in de stream of water, de dogs gits after 'em and drowns 'em.
Den Nick, de overseer, he whop 'em. He drive down four stakes for de
feets and hands and tie 'em up. Den he whop 'em from head to feets. De
whip make out a hide, cut in strips, with holes punch in 'em. When dey
hits de skin it make blisters.


"All kind of war talk floatin' round 'fore de Yankees come. Some say de
Yankees fight for freedom and some say dey'll kill all de slaves. Seems
like it must have been in de middle of de war dat de Yankees come by. We
hears somebody holler for us to come out one night and seed de place on
fire. Time we git out dere, de Yankees gone. We fit de fire but we had
to tote water in buckets, and de fire burn up de gin house full of
cotton and de cotton house, too, and de corn crib.


"De Yankees allus come through at night and done what dey gwine to do,
and den wait for more night 'fore dey go 'bout dere business. Only one
time dey come in daylight, and some de slaves jine dem and go to war.


"All de talk 'bout freedom git so bad on de plantation de massa make me
put de men in a big wagon and drive 'em to Winfield. He say in Texas
dere never be no freedom. I driv 'em fast till night and it take 'bout
two days. But dey come back home, but massa say if he cotch any of 'em
he gwine shoot 'em. Dey hang round de woods and dodge round and round
till de freedom man come by.


"We went right on workin' after freedom. Old Buck Adams wouldn't let us
go. It was way after freedom dat de freedom man come and read de paper,
and tell us not to work no more 'less us git pay for it. When he gone,
old Mary Adams, she come out. I 'lect what she say as if I jes' hear her
say it. She say, 'Ten years from today I'll have you all back 'gain.'
Dat ten years been over a mighty long time and she ain't git us back yit
and she dead and gone.


"Dey makes us git right off de place, jes' like you take a old hoss and
turn it loose. Dat how us was. No money, no nothin'. I git a job workin'
for a white man on he farm, but he couldn't pay much. He didn't have
nothin'. He give me jes' 'nough to git a peck or two of meal and a li'l
syrup.


"I allus works in de fields and makes baskets, big old cotton baskets
and bow baskets make out of white oak. I work down de oak to make de
splits and make de bow basket to tote de lunch. Den I make trays and mix
bowls. I go out and cut down de big poplar and bust off de big block and
sit down 'straddle, and holler it out big as I wants it, and make de
bread tray. I make collars for hosses and ox whops and quirts out of
beef hide. But I looses my eyesight a couple years back and I can't do
nothin' no more. My gal takes care of me.


"I come here in 1931. Dat de first time I'm out of Franklin Parish. I
allus git along some way till I'm blind. My gal am good to me, but de
days am passin' and soon I'll be gone, too."








Hiram Mayes




*Hiram Mayes thinks he was born in 1862, a slave of Tom Edgar, who owned
a plantation in Double Bayou, Texas. Hiram lives with two daughters in a
rambling farmhouse near Beaumont, less than three miles from his
birthplace on the old Edgar homestead near the Iron Bridge. For thirty
years Hiram has served as Worshipful Master of the Masonic Lodge (Negro)
in the vicinity. Native intelligence gleams in his deep-set eyes, but
his speech shows that he received little schooling.*


"De fust thing I 'members back in slavery time was gittin' in de
master's strawberry patch. He's right proud of dat patch and git after
us plenty. Dey was li'l Tim Edgar, dat de white boy, and me. Tim, he
still livin' down in Wallisville. Old master he cut us both a couple
times for thiefin' he strawberries, jes' give us a bresh or two to skeer
us. Dat de onlies' time he ever did whip me and you couldn' hardly call
that a whippin'.


"Old man Tom Edgar was my master and de old Edgar place was down below
where Jackson's store is and 'bout two mile from where I lives now. Some
de brick from dat house still standin' dere in de woods.


"My mama name Mary and Dolf Mayes my papa, and I's borned 'bout 1862, I
guess, 'cause I wasn't very big when freedom come. I did most my playin'
with young master, Tim, him and me 'bout de same age.


"Old master was sho' good to he slaves and dey ain't never have no cruel
overseer nor no lot of whippin' like some masters did. Mama work in de
white folks' house and done de cookin' in de big kitchen. De big house
was a big, low place with galleries 'round it. Mama tie me to a chair
leg on de gallery to keep me from runnin' off to de bayou. Dey 'fraid of
alligators. Dem 'gators never did eat no cullud chillen 'round us place,
but dey allus 'fraid day would. Dey sich big snakes in de woods, too,
dey skeered of dem.


"De cullud folks all have li'l brick cabin quarters and dey have a
brickyard right near de place what a white man own and he make de bricks
what dey calls Cedar Bayou brick 'count of de mud being diff'rent. I's
born in one dem li'l brick houses. I don't 'member none my grandfolks
'cept my papa's mama, call Martha Godfry. She come from Virginny, and
'long to de Mayes where my papa born.


"I never did bother with Sunday School much, me. Dey one on de bayou and
a white lady, Miss Joseph, am de teacher. Dey wasn't no school but after
I git free I go to school on de edge of de woods. Dey have teacher name
Runnells and a old blue-back speller to larn out of.


"After us freed my papa move up de prairie a ways and hire out to ride
de range. Dey done larn me to ride when I 'bout five, six year old and I
rid with de old man. Dat ridin' business was jes' my job. My daddy never
did like to settle down and farm, but druther ride de range for four
bits or six bits de day. De old master done give us nothin', jes' turn
us adrift, but he didn't have much and everybody jes' have to shift for
demselves dem days. Us git 'long all right makin' money with de
cattlemen.


"De prairie lands a good place to git things to eat and us see plenty
deers, sometime eight or ten in de bunch. Dey lots of wolves roamin'
'round lookin' for stray cows. Dat when de whip come in handy, to knock
dem on de head. Never hear tell of but one bear, and us cotch him on Gum
Island and kill him. You know dem funny lookin', horny things dey calls
armadillos? Dey been immigrate here 'bout ten year ago. Dey come from
somewhere but us ain't knowed why. Dey never was none here in slavery
time but plenty horny frogs and 'gators.


"I marry 51 year ago to Wilina Day and I's still marry to her. Us marry
in her brudder's house with jes' homefolks. Dey's nine chillen and eight
still livin' and most dem farmers, 'cept two boys in de reg'lar army.
Dey am Dolf and Robert. Oscar runs de fillin' station at Double Bayou.
Oscar was in France in de World War. I has two my gals with me here and
two grandchillen.


"I rode de range till 'bout 20 year ago and den I start gittin' purty
old, so I settles down to farmin'. Dey charter a Masonic lodge here in
1906, I 'lieve it were number naught six, and dey put me up for
Worshipful Master of de bunch. After dey vouch for me I git de chair and
I been sittin' in de east for 30 year."








Susan Merritt




*Susan Merritt, 87, was born in Rusk Co., Texas, a slave of Andrew Watt.
A year after she was freed, Susan moved with her parents to Harrison
Co., and stayed on their farm until she married Will Merritt. They
reared fifteen children. Susan has little to say of her life from 1865
to the present, stating that they got along on the farm they worked on
shares. Since her husband's death Susan lives with a son, Willie, west
of Marshall, Texas, on the Hynson Springs Road.*


"I couldn't tell how old I is, but does you think I'd ever forgit them
slave days? I 'lieve I's 'bout 87 or more, 'cause I's a good size gal
spinnin all the thread for the white folks when they lets us loose after
surrender.


"I's born right down in Rusk County, not a long way from Henderson, and
Massa Andrew Watt am my owner. My pappy, Bob Rollins, he come from North
Carolina and belonged to Dave Blakely and mammy come from Mississippi.
Mammy have eleven of us chillen but four dies when they babies, but
Albert, Hob, John, Emma, Anna, Lula and me lives to be growed and
married.


"Massa Watt lived in a big log house what sot on a hill so you could see
it 'round for miles, and us lived over in the field in little log huts,
all huddled along together. They have home-made beds nailed to the wall
and baling sack mattresses, and us call them bunks. Us never had no
money but plenty clothes and grub and wear the same clothes all the year
'round. Massa Watt made our shoes for winter hisself and he made
furniture and saddles and harness and run a grist mill and a whiskey
still there on the place. That man had ev'ything.


"The hands was woke with the big bell and when massa pulls that bell
rope the niggers falls out them bunks like rain fallin'. They was in
that field 'fore day and stay till dusk dark. They work slap up till
Saturday night and then washes their clothes, and sometimes they gits
through and has time for the party and plays ring plays. I 'member part
the words to one play and that, 'Rolling river, roll on, the old cow die
in cold water ... now we's got to drink bad water 'cause old cow die in
cold water,' but I can't 'member more'n that. It's too long ago.


"When the hands come in from the field at dusk dark, they has to tote
water from the spring and cook and eat and be in bed when that old bell
rings at nine o'clock. 'Bout dusk they calls the chillen and gives 'em a
piece of corn pone 'bout size my hand and a tin cup milk and puts them
to bed, but the growed folks et fat pork and greens and beans and sich
like and have plenty milk. Ev'ry Sunday massa give 'em some flour and
butter and a chicken. Lots of niggers caught a good cowhiding for
slippin' 'round and stealin' a chicken 'fore Sunday.


"Massa Watt didn't have no overseer, but he have a nigger driver what am
jus' as bad. He carry a long whip 'round the neck and I's seed him tie
niggers to a tree and cowhide 'em till the blood run down onto the
ground. Sometimes the women gits slothful and not able to do their part
but they makes 'em do it anyway. They digs a hole, 'bout body deep, and
makes them women lie face down in it and beats 'em nearly to death. That
nigger driver beat the chillen for not keepin' their cotton row up with
the lead man. Sometimes he made niggers drag long chains while they
works in the field and some of 'em run off, but they oughtn't to have
done it, 'cause they chase 'em with hounds and nearly kilt 'em.


"Lots of times Massa Watt give us a pass to go over to George Petro's
place or Dick Gregg's place. Massa Petro run a slave market and he have
big, high scaffold with steps where he sells slaves. They was stripped
off to the waist to show their strengt'.


"Our white folks have a church and a place for us in the back. Sometimes
at night us gather 'round the fireplace and pray and sing and cry, but
us daren't 'low our white folks know it. Thank the Lawd us can worship
where us wants nowadays. I 'member one song we allus sing:


    "'I heard the voice of Jesus callin'
    Come unto me and live
    Lie, lie down, weepin' one
    Res' they head on my breast.


    "'I come to Jesus as I was
    Weary and lone and tired and sad,
    I finds in him a restin' place,
    And he has made me glad.'


"Us have two white doctors call Dr. Dan and Dr. Gill Shaw, what wait on
us when we real sick. Us wore asafoetida bags 'round the neck and it
kep' off sickness.


"I stay mos' the time in the big house and massa good but missy am the
devil. I couldn't tell you how I treated. Lots of times she tie me to a
stob in the yard and cowhide me till she give out, then she go and rest
and come back and beat me some more. You see, I's massa nigger and she
have her own niggers what come on her side and she never did like me.
She stomp and beat me nearly to death and they have to grease my back
where she cowhide me and I's sick with fever for a week. If I have a
dollar for ev'ry cowhidin' I git, I'd never have to work no more.




[Illustration: _Susan Merritt_]




"Young missy Betty like me and try larn me readin' and writin' and she
slip to my room and have me doin' right good. I larn the alphabet. But
one day Missy Jane cotch her schoolin' me and she say, 'Niggers don't
need to know anything,' and she lams me over the head with the butt of a
cowhide whip. That white woman so rough, one day us makin' soap and some
little chickens gits in the fire 'round the pot and she say I let 'em do
it and make me walk barefoot through that bed of coals sev'ral times.


"I hears 'bout freedom in September and they's pickin' cotton and a
white man rides up to massa's house on a big, white hoss and the
houseboy tell massa a man want see him and he hollers, 'Light,
stranger.' It a gov'ment man and he have the big book and a bunch papers
and say why ain't massa turn the niggers loose. Massa say he tryin' git
the crop out and he tell massa have the slaves in. Uncle Steven blows
the cow horn what they use to call to eat and all the niggers come
runnin', 'cause that horn mean, 'Come to the big house, quick.' That man
reads the paper tellin' us we's free, but massa make us work sev'ral
months after that. He say we git 20 acres land and a mule but we didn't
git it.


"Lots of niggers was kilt after freedom, 'cause the slaves in Harrison
County turn loose right at freedom and them in Rusk County wasn't. But
they hears 'bout it and runs away to freedom in Harrison County and they
owners have 'em bushwhacked, that shot down. You could see lots of
niggers hangin' to trees in Sabine bottom right after freedom, 'cause
they catch 'em swimmin' 'cross Sabine River and shoot 'em. They sho' am
goin' be lots of soul cry 'gainst 'em in Judgment!"








Josh Miles




*Josh Miles, 78, was born in Richmond, Virginia, a slave of the Miles
family. In 1862 Mr. Miles brought his family and slaves to Franklin,
Texas. After he was freed, Josh worked for the railroad until he was
laid off because of old age. He lives in Mart, Texas.*


"I was born in Richmond, in Virginny, back in 1859, and my mammy and
pappy was slaves to a man named Miles, what lived in Richmond but owned
three plantations out a few miles, and 'bout fifteen hundred niggers.
Pappy was de fam'ly coachman and druv de li'l surrey when Massa gwine
see he plantations. On Sunday he druv de big coach to church. De Old
Massa wear de big stove-pipe hat and de long-skirt coat and he big
boots. Pappy, he wear de tall hat with de blue uniform with brass
buttons, and black, shiny boots. He have de long horsewhip to crack at
dem hosses--he drive four or six hosses, 'cause dat coach am big and
heavy and de roads am often muddy.


"Massa allus went to de big fairs in Louisville and Richmond, where de
big hoss races am. Dey name de hosses for Abe Lincoln and Steve Douglas,
in 1860. De bettin' song what dey sings am like dis:


    "'Dere's a old plow hoss, whose name am Doug, doo, dah,
    doo-dah--
    He's short and thick, a reg'lar plug, oh, doo, dah, doo-dah,
    doo--
    We're born to work all night, we're born to work all day,
    I'll bet my money on de Lincoln hoss, who bets on Steven A?'


"Well, dat de way us lives jes' befo' de war. When de presidents calls
for volunteers, Virginny goes for de Rebels, and dey moves de capitol to
Richmond. So Old Massa sees he'll be right in de thick of de war and he
'cides to come to Texas. He gits he slaves and he folks and hosses and
cattle and he household things in de covered wagon and starts. Course,
de hosses and cattle walks, and so does us niggers. But massa take he
time and stops wherever he wants. It takes two years to make de trip. He
stay de whole winter one place, and stops in Nashville and Memphis and
Vicksburg. All dese places he trade de hosses and mules and oxen and
niggers and everything else he have. But he wouldn't trade he pers'nal
slaves. Dey have de big warehouse in places like Memphis, and take de
nigger de day befo' de sale and give him plenty to eat to make him look
in good humor. Dey chain him up de night befo' de sale, and iffen he am
de fightin' nigger, dey handcuffs him. De auctioneer say, 'Dis nigger am
eighteen year old, sound as de dollar, can pick 300 pounds of cotton a
day, good disposition, easy to manage, come up 'xamine him.' Dey strips
him to de waist and everybody look him over and de good ones brung
$1,500 sometimes. I seed de old mammy and her two boys and gals sold.
One man buys de boys and old mammy cry, but it don't do no good. 'Nother
man bids de two gals and mammy throw such a fit her old massa throws her
in, 'cause she too old to be much 'count.


"De siege of Vicksburg 'gins jus' after old massa done left there, on he
way to Texas. He friends tell him all 'bout it. Coffee was $4.00 de
pound, tea $18.00, butter to $2.00 de pound, corn $15.00 de bar'l,
calico $1.75 de yard and muslin 'bout $7.00 de yard. De Rebels holds de
city long as they could. De bluff over de city have de caves in it and
dey's rented for high rent. Flour am $10.00 de pound and bacon $5.00.
Dey eats mule meat, and dey give it de French name, 'Mule tongue cold, a
la bray.'


"We keep's up with what happen and after de war dey tells us 'bout
Richmond. De lab'tory am blowed up Friday, and de Stuart home burnt.
Befo' Richmond am taken, dey sings dis song:


    "Would you like to hear my song?
    I'm 'fraid its rather long--
    Of de 'On to Richmond,' double trouble,
    Of de half a dozen trips
    And de half a dozen slips,
    And de latest bustin' of de bubble.


    "'Pull off you coat and roll up you sleeve,
    For Richmond am a hard road to travel--
    Then pull off you coat and roll up you sleeve.
    For Richmond am a hard road to travel.'


"Dey sung dat song to de old tune call 'Old Rosin de Beau.'




[Illustration: _Josh Miles_]




"De war ends and in de few months old massa sot he slaves free. He give
my pappy some money and he starts out for heself. He goes to Milligan
and rents land and raises he fam'ly. Old Massa never goes back to
Richmond. De Yanks gits what he left so dey no use gwine back dere. He
lives in Franklin till 1914. It ain't like Old Virginny, but dey's
plenty wild game and hawgs and he raises a bale of cotton to de acre, so
he have money once more.


"Dey's folks comin' to Texas all de time from de old states. It am de
new world and dey likes it. Dey has de Juneteenth cel'brations after
'while, and de white folks gives us beeves and hawgs to barbecue, so
Texas am de good place to stay.


"When I's 'bout growed, I starts workin' on de I. & G.N. railroad and
helps build it from Houston into Waco. I works for it for years and
years, and allus lives near de Brazos River. I's lived here in Mart
forty years.


"I doesn't have de bitter mem'ries like some de niggers. 'Cause Old
Massa allus good to us. I's had de good life and am 'bout ready to go to
Hebben, and hopes I can see Old Massa dere."








Anna Miller




*Anna Miller, 85, lives with her daughter, Lucy Watkins, at 407 W. Bluff
St., Ft. Worth, Texas. She was born a slave in Kentucky, and was sold,
with her parents, to Mark Loyed, a farmer in Missouri. He later sold
Anna's mother, before Anna was old enough to remember her. When Anna was
8, her owner moved to Palo Pinto, Texas.*


"I'se now 'bout 85 years ole, dat's what de white folks tells me. I'se
bo'n in Kentuck'. My mammy, pappy and I'se sold by our fust marster to
Marster Mark Loyed, who lived in Missouri. He takes us to him's farm.
When I'se 'bout eight years ole, Marster Loyed sold him's farm and comes
to Texas in covered wagons and oxen. He's brung all de slaves wid him.
I'se don' 'member much 'bout de trip, cause I'se sick wid de fever. I'se
so bad, de marster thinks I'se goin' to die. One mornin' he comes and
looks at me and says, 'Dis nigger am too val'able to die. We'd better
doctor her.' We camps for six days.


"We comes to Palo Pinto and dat's wild country den. Plenty of Indians,
but dey never trouble we'uns. My work, 'twas helpin' wid de chores and
pick up de brush whar my pappy was a-clearin' de land. When I gits
bigger, I'se plowed, hoed, and done all de goin' to de mill. I'se helps
card, spins and cuts de thread. We'uns makes all de cloth for to makes
de clothes, but we don' git 'em. In de winter we mos' freeze to death.
De weavin' was de night work, after workin' all de day in de fiel'.


"Dey sho whups us. I'se gits whupped lots a times. Marster whups de men
and missus whups de women. Sometimes she whups wid de nettleweed. When
she uses dat, de licks ain't so bad, but de stingin' and de burnin'
after am sho' misery. Dat jus' plum runs me crazy. De mens use de rope
when dey whups.


"'Bout eatin', we keeps full on what we gits, such as beans, co'nmeal
and 'lasses. We seldom gits meat. White flour, we don' know what dat
taste like. Jus' know what it looks like. We gits 'bout all de milk we
wants, 'cause dey puts it in de trough and we helps ourselves. Dere was
a trough for de niggers and one for de hawgs.


"Jus' 'bout a month befo' freedom, my sis and nigger Horace runs off.
Dey don' go far, and stays in de dugout. Ev'ry night dey'd sneak in and
git 'lasses and milk and what food dey could. My sis had a baby and she
nuss it ev'ry night when she comes. Dey runs off to keep from gettin' a
whuppin'. De marster was mad 'cause dey lets a mule cut hisself wid de
plow. Sis says de bee stung de mule and he gits unruly and tangle in de
plow. Marster says, 'Dey can' go far and will come back when dey gits
hongry.'


"I'se don' know much 'bout de war. De white folks don' talk to us 'bout
de war and we'uns don' go to preachin' or nothin', so we can't larn
much. When freedom comes, marster says to us niggers, 'All dat wants to
go, git now. You has nothin'.' And he turns dem away, nothin' on 'cept
ole rags. 'Twarn't enough to cover dere body. No hat, no shoes, no
unnerwear.


"My pappy and mos' de niggers goes, but I'se have to stay till my pappy
finds a place for me. He tells me dat he'll come for me. I'se have to
wait over two years. De marster gets worser in de disposition and goes
'roun' sort of talkin' to hisse'f and den he gits to cussin' ev'rybody.


"In 'bout a year after freedom, Marster Loyed moves from Palo Pinto to
Fort Worth. He says he don' want to live in a country whar de niggers am
free. He kills hisse'f 'bout a year after dey moves. After dat, I'se
sho' glad when pappy comes for me. He had settled at Azle on a rented
farm and I'se lives wid him for 'bout ten years. Den I'se goes and stays
wid my brudder on Ash Creek. De three of us rents land and us runs dat
farm.


"I'se git married 'bout four years after I'se goes to Ash Creek, to Bell
Johnson. We had four chillen. He works for white folks. 'Bout nine years
after we married my husban' gits drowned and den I works for white folks
and cares for my chillen for fo'teen years. Then I'se gits married
again. I'se married Fred Miller, a cook, and we lived in Fort Worth. In
1915 he goes 'way to cook for de road 'struction camp and dats de las'
I'se hears of dat no 'count nigger!


"Lots of difference when freedom comes. Mos' de time after, I'se have
what I wants to eat. Sometime 'twas a little hard to git, but we gits
on. I'se goes to preachin' and has music and visit wid de folks I'se
like. But Marster Loyed makes us work from daylight to dark in de fiel's
and make cloth at night."








Mintie Maria Miller




*Mintie Maria Miller, 1404 39th St., Galveston, Texas, was born in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 1852. She has forgotten her first master's name,
but was sold while very young to Dr. Massie, of Lynchburg, Texas. The
journey to Texas took three months by ox-cart. After the Civil War
Mintie went to Houston and stayed with an old colored woman whose former
master had given her a house. Later she went to Galveston, where she has
worked for one family 24 years.*


"I was born in Alabama in 1852, in Tuscaloosa and my mammy's name was
Hannah, but I don't know my pappy's name. When I was still pretty little
my brother and uncle and aunt and mother was sold and me with 'em.


"Dr. Massie brung us to Texas in an ox-cart but my sister had to stay
with the old mistress and that the last I ever seen my sister. She was
four year old then.


"After we reaches Texas we lives on a great big place, somewhere 'round
Lynchburg and Dr. Massie have two girls and I sleeps on the foot of they
bed. They nice to me, they spoil me, in fac'. I plays with the white
gals and they feeds me from they tables and in the evenin' my mammy
takes me down to de bayou and wash my face and put me on a clean dress.


"My mammy cook for the white folks and they treats us both fine, but one
gal I knowed was 'bout 8 or 9 and she run away from her master and swim
de Trinity River and it was winter and her feets freezes. He cotches dis
gal and puts her feets in the fire to thaw 'em, and burnt 'em. The law
say you could take slaves 'way from sich a man, so Dr. Frost takes her
away from that man and gives her to Miss Nancy what was de mistress at
Dr. Massie's place.


"Then they says they gwine sell me, 'cause Miss Nancy's father-in-law
dies and they got rid of some of us. She didn't want to sell me so she
tell me to be sassy and no one would buy me. They takes me to Houston
and to the market and a man call George Fraser sells the slaves. The
market was a open house, more like a shed. We all stands to one side
till our turn comes. They wasn't nothin' else you could do.


"They stands me up on a block of wood and a man bid me in. I felt mad.
You see I was young then, too young to know better. I don't know what
they sold me for, but the man what bought me made me open my mouth while
he looks at my teeth. They done all us that-a-way, sells us like you
sell a hoss. Then my old master bids me goodby and tries to give me a
dog, but I 'members what Miss Nancy done say and I sassed him and
slapped the dog out of his hand. So the man what bought me say, 'When
one o'clock come you got to sell her 'gain, she's sassy. If she done me
that way I'd kill her.' So they sells me twice the same day. They was
two sellin's that day.


"My new master, Tom Johnson, lives in Lynchburg and owns the river boat
there, and has a little place, 'bout one acre, on the bayou. Then the
war comes and jes' 'fore war come to Galveston they took all the
steamships in the Buffalo Bayou and took the cabins off and made ships.
They put cotton bales 'round them and builded 'em up high with the
cotton, to cotch the cannonballs. Two of 'em was the Island City, and
the Neptune.


"Then freedom cries and the master say we all free and I goes to Houston
with my mammy. We stays with a old colored woman what has a house her
old master done give her and I finishes growin' there and works some.
But then I comes to Galveston and hired out here and I been workin' for
these white folks 24 year now."








Tom Mills




*Tom Mills was born in Fayette Co., Alabama, in 1858, a slave of George
Patterson, who owned Tom's father and mother. In 1862 George Patterson
moved to Texas, bringing Tom and his mother, but not his father. After
they were freed, it was difficult for Tom's mother to earn a living and
they had a hard time for several years, until Tom was old enough to go
to work on a ranch, as a cow-hand. In 1892 Tom undertook stock farming,
finally settling in Uvalde in 1919. He now lives in a four-room house he
built himself. A peach orchard and a grape arbor shade the west side of
the house and well-fed cows are in the little pasture. Tom is contented
and optimistic and says he can "do a lot of work yet."*


"I was born in Alabama, in Fayette Co., in 1858. My mother was named
Emaline Riley and my father was named Thad Mills. My sisters were named
Ella and Ann and Lou and Maggie and Matildy, and the youngest one was
Easter. I had two brothers, Richard and Ben. Bob Lebruc was my
great-uncle and for a long while he ran a freight wagon from Salt Lakes
to this country. That was the only way of getting salt to Texas, this
part of Texas, I mean, because Salt Lakes is down east of Corpus, close
to the bay. My uncle was finally killed by the Indians in Frio County.


"In Alabama we lived on Patterson's place. The grandmother of all these
Pattersons was Betsy Patterson and we lived on her estate. My mother
wove the cloth. It kep' her pretty busy, but she was stout and active.
My uncle was blacksmith and made all the plows, too.


"We had a picket house, one room, and two beds built in corners.


"My mother done the cookin' up at the house because she was workin' up
there all the time, weavin' cloth, and of course we ate up there. The
rest of 'em didn't like it much because we ate up there, but her work
was there. I guess you never did see a loom? It used to keep me pretty
busy fillin' quills. She made this cloth--this four-dollar-a-yard,
four-leaf jean cloth, all wool, of course.


"I was too little to work durin' the war; of course we packed a little
water and got a little wood. I was goin' to tell you about this scar on
my finger. I was holdin' a stick for another little fellow to cut wood
and he nearly cut my finger off. That sure woke me up.


"They had field work on the place, but a family by the name of Knowles
did the farm work. I worked stock nearly all my life. It used to be all
the work there was. I think my mother was allowed to make a little money
on this cloth business. That is, cloth she made on the outside. And she
was the only one of the slaves that could read. I don't know that they
cared anything about her readin', but they didn't want her to read it to
the rest of 'em. I never earned no money; I was too little.


"We called Old Man Patterson 'master' and we called Mrs. Patterson
'mistuss'.


"I don't know what the other slaves had to eat--they cooked for
themselves, but we had jes' what the Pattersons had to eat. On Sunday
mornin' we had flour bread. Always glad to see Sunday mornin' come. We
made the co'n meal right on the place on these old hand mills that you
turn with both hands like this. When the co'n jes' fust began to get
ha'd, they would grate that; but when it got ha'd, they would grind it.
We always had meat the year 'round. We called hogshead cheese 'souse'.
But we never did make sausage then. It was a long time before we had a
sausage mill. Oh, sho' we made 'chittlin's' (chitterlings). We make them
even now. Why mama always takes the paunch and fixes it up ever' time we
kill hogs. We dried beef, strung it out, and put it on the line. When we
got ready to cook it, we'd take it and beat it and make hash and fry it
or boil it. We had lots of deer and turkeys, quail and 'possums, but
they never did do much eatin' rabbits. I didn't eat no 'possums and I
didn't eat no honey; there was sever'l things I didn't like. I like
straight beef, turkeys, quail and squirrel is mighty fine eatin'. I set
traps and would ketch quail. Armadillos are pretty good meat, but we
didn't eat 'em then. Why, I was grown before I ever saw an armadillo. I
don't know where they immigrated from. Yes'm, I think they come from
Mexico; they must surely have because they wasn't any here when I was a
young boy. We used to see 'em in shows before they ever got to be around
here.


"I wore a shirt that hit me down about my knees. When my mother made my
pants, she made 'em all in one piece, sleeves 'n all. The fust shoes I
ever had, my uncle tanned the leather and made 'em. I guess I was about
six years old. He made the pegs, tanned the leather, and made the shoes.
It taken 18 months to tan the leather. Bark tanned. Huh, I c'n smell
that old tannin' vat now. People nowadays, they're livin' too easy.
'Fraid to let a drop of water fall on 'em.


"Ever' day was Sunday with me then. After we got up any size, they put
us to work, but we didn't work on Sunday. After I got to be a cowboy, of
course, they didn't have no Sunday then.


"I was twenty-two when I fust married. It was in Medina County. Her name
was Ada Coston. She had on a white dress, draggin' the groun' in the
back, what you used to call these trains. I remember when they wore
these hoops, too. We married about 7 o'clock in the evenin'. I had on
one of these frock-tail coats, black broadcloth suit. I had on good
shop-made shoes. We had better shoes then than we ever have now. We had
a supper and then danced. Had a big weddin' cake--great big white one,
had a hole in the center, all iced all over. I think my auntie made that
cake, or my cousin. We had coffee, but I never did drink whiskey in my
life. I think they had chickens--if I remember right, chicken and
dressin'. Had a whole lot better to eat then than I can get now. We
danced all night. I was at a weddin' where they danced three days and
nights, and I tell you where it was. Have you been down to Old Bill
Thomas'? You have? Well, that was where it took place. Bill and Ellen
married when I was about twelve years old, and I think they danced three
days and nights, and maybe longer. Now, if they didn't tell you that, I
could'a told you if I had been there. We danced these old square dances,
what you call the Virginia Reel, and the round dances like the
Schottische, Polka, waltzes, and all them. I was a dancin' fool, wanted
to dance all the time. I inherited that from my mother. She was a
terrible dancer.


"Old Man George Patterson was a very tall and a dark complected man. He
was a kind old man. He was good to my mother and all those that come
from Alabama. The old mistuss would whip me, but he didn't. The
grandchillun and I could fight all over the house; he would jes' get out
of the way. But she would get on us once in awhile. The worst whippin'
she ever give me was about some sheep. They had a cane patch down close
to the sheep pen and I went down there and got me some cane and stripped
it off and I was runnin' 'round down there whippin' the sheep with that
stalk of cane and she found me down there and took me to the house and
learned me better. They never did whip my mother. I know they whipped
two others. Two was all I ever knew of 'em whippin'. Dillard, he married
the oldest Patterson girl, and my uncle, he borrowed an auger from Mr.
Dillard to make a frame. When dinner time came, he laid it down and went
to his dinner. When he got back, this bit was broken and he went and
tells him (Dillard) and they came down to make a search about who had
used it. They found that another colored man got it and used it to bore
some holes with and broke it, so he took it back and laid it down and
never said nothin'. Them days, a thing like that steel bit was awful
high. They laid 'im over a log and whipped 'im and whipped his wife for
not tellin' it when they asked her. They had a boy countin' the licks,
but I don't know how many he got. They had me down there too, and I was
ready to get away from there. I think they had us down there to show
what we would get if we didn't do right.


"The old lady, the mistuss, she was pretty high-tempered--her head kind
of bounced, like that--when she got mad. She was slender and tall. I
think they lived in a log house; I don't remember much what kind of
house it was. I know my mother weaved cloth in one part of it.


"I don't think the field was very large on that place. I often wanted to
go back and see it. It was right on the Sabinal, right opposite Knowlton
Creek.


"I have heard my mother tell about slaves bein' sold. It was kinda like
a fair they have now. They would go there, and some of 'em sold for a
thousand dollars. They said somethin' about puttin' 'em on a block; the
highest bidder, you know, would buy 'em. I don't know how they got 'em
there, for they wasn't much of a way for 'em to go 'cept by oxen, you
know. It was back in Alabama where she saw all that. Of course, there
was more of that down in Mississippi than Alabama, but she didn't know
nothin' about that.


"I remember the cotton they raised on the Patterson place. They picked
the seeds out with their fingers and made cloth out of it. They would
take coarse wool--not merino wool, for that was too fine--and use the
coarse wool for a filler. That was what they would make me do, pick the
seed out of that cotton to keep me out of mischief. I remember that
pretty well. Kep' me tied down, and I would beg the old man to let me
go, and when he did, if I got into anything, I was back there pickin'
seeds pretty quick.


"We would get up about daybreak. They might have got up before I knew
anything about it, but sometimes I got up with my mother.


"What little school I went to was German, at D'Hanis and Castroville. I
went to the priest at D'Hanis and to the sisters at Castroville. No
education to amount to anything. That was after we were freed. I went to
school at the same time that Johnny Ney and his sister, Mary, went to
school. I would like to see Johnny and talk to him now. Your grandmother
and her sisters and brothers went to that school and I remember all of
'em well. One of them boys, George, was killed and scalped by the
Indians, and that was caused by them boys playin' and scarin' each other
all the time. He was with them Rothe boys, and they always had an Indian
scare up someway to have fun with each other, especially to scare
George. So when they did discover the Indians and hollered to George, he
wouldn't run, because they had fooled 'im so much. So the Indians
slipped up on him and killed 'im.


"Yes, I knew all the Millers better than I did nearly any of the rest of
the old settlers up there. Aunt Dorcas, that was George's mother, she
nursed me through the measles. I was awful sick, and when my mother
heard it and come up after me, she told my mother to leave me there, she
would take care of me. I tell you she took good care of me too.


"But that was after freedom. You see, my mother didn't want to come to
Texas. She laid out nearly two years before they got hold of her and got
her to come to Texas. Alabama wasn't thickly settled then. There was
bottoms of trees and wild fruit she could eat. She stayed out by
herself, and would come and get something to eat and leave again. But
Patterson told her if she would come to Texas she would be treated right
and not be whipped or nothin' like that. And so far as I know, she never
was whipped. He kep' his word with her. She was useful and they needed
her. She wove the cloth and was such a good worker.


"The first cow we ever owned, we cut cockleburrs out of a field of about
seven or eight acres. Mr. John Ware gave her a cow to cut the burrs out.


"After the war, my uncle carried my mother and his wife and chillen
away, and when they started with Margaret--she was his niece and my
cousin--they overtook 'em and took Margaret back. She was house girl,
she didn't do nothin' but work in the house. I don't know whether they
ever paid her anything or not. They needed her to wait on the old lady.


"I don't know how that come about when they told 'em they was free. I
don't know whether mother read it in the paper or he come and told 'em.
We went on, and came right on up the same creek to a place where a man
had a ranch by the name of Roney. It was an old abonded (abandoned)
place, and we didn't have anything to eat. My uncle got out and rustled
around to get some bread stuff and got some co'n, but while he was gone
was when we suffered for something to eat. We didn't have anything to
kill wild game with. We would fish a little. When he left he went up in
the Davenport settlement, up there about where your grandfather lived.
We got milk and careless weeds, but that was all we had, and we were
awful glad to see the co'n come. And that was my first taste of javelin
(javelina). It evidently was an old male javelin, for I couldn't eat it.
I don't think my uncle ever stole anything in his life. I was with him
all the time and I know he didn't. My mother, she went over to
Davenports' and my uncle got out and rustled to see where he could get
something to do. So they moved up in the Sabinal Canyon and he got on
Old Man Joel Fenley's place.


"Old Man 'Parson' Monk, I think, was the first person I ever heard
preach. That was down here in the Patterson settlement (formerly a
settlement six miles south of the present town of Sabinal). The
preachin' was right there on the place. I joined the church after I was
grown, but that was the cullud church, then. My mother she joined the
white church. She joined the Hardshell Baptist. She never did live in
any colony and the cullud church was too far. They had lots of camp
meetin's. I never was at but one camp meetin' that I know of. They would
preach and shout and have a good time and have plenty to eat. That was
what most of 'em went for. But the churches then seemed to be more
serious than they are now. They preached the 'altar.' You know, like
anyone wanted to join the church, they was a mourner, you see, seekin'
for religion. And they would sing and pray with 'em till they professed
the religion. I had a sister that never went to a meetin' that she
didn't get to shoutin' and shout to the end of the sermon. I always
tried to get out of the way before I joined because if she got to me,
she would beat on me and talk to me. We always tried to get to her, if
she had her baby in her arms, because she would jes' throw that baby
away when the Spirit moved her.


"Did you ever know of Monroe Brackins over at Hondo City? Well, I and
him was both jes' boys and was with Jess Campbell, Joe Dean and a man
named McLemore. They was white men. We went down on the Frio River, and
there was some pens down there on the Johnson place. They was three
brothers of them Johnsons. We had a little bunch of cattle, goin' down
there. This Jess Campbell and Joe Dean was full of devilment and they
knew Monroe was awful scarey. When we penned the cattle that evenin' it
was late and Monroe noticed a pile of brush at the side of the gate. He
asked 'em what you reckin that was there, and they told him they was a
man killed and buried there. That night after dark they was fixin' to
get supper ready and told Monroe to go get some water down at the river,
but he wouldn't do it. Well, I never was afraid of the dark in my life,
so I had to go get the water. Well, we made a fire and fixed supper and
then these men put a rope on Monroe and took him off a little piece and
wrapped the rope around a tree and never even tied the rope fast. The
other man, McLemore, he went around the camp and came up on the other
side. He had an old dried cow hide with the tail still on it. The old
tail was all bent, crimped up. Here he come from down the creek, from
where they told Monroe that fellow was buried, and right toward Monroe
with that hide on. Tail first and in the dark it looked pretty bad, and,
I tell you, Monroe got to screamin'. I believe he would have died if
they hadn't let him loose. I never laughed so much in my life. When he
would get scared, he would squeal like a hog. He sure was scarey.


"Sometimes, I know, we would be woke up in the night and they would be
cookin' chicken and dumplin's, or havin' somethin' like that. I'd like
for 'em to come ever' night and wake me up. I don't know where it come
from, but they would always wake the chillen up and let 'em have some of
it. (This is an early recollection of his childhood during slavery.)


"My mother's daddy, if he was here, he could tell plenty of things. He
could remember all about them days, and sing them songs too. I've heard
him tell some mighty bad things, and he told somethin' pretty bad on
hisself. He said they captured some Indian chillen and he was carryin
one and it got to cryin' and he jes' took his saber and held it up by
its feet and cut its head off. Couldn't stan' to hear it cry. He got
punished for it, but he said he was a soldier and not supposed to carry
Indian babies. Usually when Indians captured little fellows like that,
they carried 'em off. Like when they carried off Frank Buckilew, a white
boy. And a cullud boy that got away up close to Utopia. They kep' the
Buckilew boy a long time, long enough that he got to where he understood
the language. It was a long time that the Indians didn't kill a darky,
though. But after the war, when they brought these cullud soldiers in
here to drive 'em back, that started the war with the cullud people
then.


"After freedom, I remember one weddin' the white folks had. That was
when John Kanedy (Kennedy) married Melinda Johnson. He was a man that
lived there on the river and was there up to the time he died. I wasn't
at the weddin', but I was at the infair. They were married east of Hondo
City. They had the infair then and it was a kind of celebration after
the weddin'. Ever'body met there and had a big dance and supper and had
a big time. They danced all night after the supper and then had a big
breakfast the next mornin'. I was little, but I remember the supper and
breakfast, for I was enjoyin' that myself. They was lots to eat, and
they had it too. After freedom, I remember these quiltin's where they
would have big dinners. They would have me there, threadin' needles for
'em. We always had a big time Christmas. They had dances and dinners for
a week. Yes'm, the cullud people did. They would celebrate the holidays
out. That was all free too, and they all had plenty to eat. They would
meet at one place one night and have a dance and supper and, the next
night, meet over at another place and have the same thing.


"When I got to workin' for myself, it was cow work. I done horseback
work for fifty years. Many a year passed that I never missed a day bein'
in the saddle. I stayed thirteen years on one ranch. The first place was
right below Hondo City. His name was Tally Burnett and I was gettin'
$7.50 a month. Went to work for that and stayed about three or four
months and he raised my wages to what the others was gettin' and that
was $12.50. He said I was as good as they were. Then I went to Frio
City. I done the same kind of work, but I went with the people that
nearly raised me, the Rutledges.


"That's where I was give twice in the census. My mother gave me in and
he gave me in. That was one time they had one man too many.


"I married when I was with them and I worked for him after that. That
was when we would work away down on the Rio Grande, when Demp Fenley and
Lee Langford and Tom Roland and the two Lease boys and one or two more
was deliverin' cattle to the Gold Franks' ranch. He wanted 8,000
two-year-old heifers. He had 150,000 acres of land and wanted cattle to
stock it. Some taken a contract to deliver so many and some taken a
contract to deliver so many, so these men I was with went down below
Laredo and down in there. We wound that up in '85. In '86, I went to
Kerr County and taken a ranch out there on the head of the Guadalupe
River. I stayed there two years and a half, till they sold out. This man
I was workin' for was from Boston, and he leased the ranch and turned it
over to me and I done all the hirin' and payin' off and buyin' and
ever'thing. When he sold out, I left and went on the Horton ranch about
thirteen months.


"My first wife died in 1892, but we had been separated about five or six
years. I married again in Bandera and quit ranchin' and went to stock
farmin' for Albert Miller, then leased a place from Charley Montague two
years, then went over into Hondo Canyon and leased a place there in '98.
We stayed there till 1906, then came to Uvalde. I leased a place out
here, about two hundred acres, four miles from town, and had odd jobs
around here too. Then, about 1907, we went to Zavala County and stayed
till 1919. I leased a place here, then, and finally settled at this
place I'm on now and have been here ever since.


"I've got 11 chillen livin'. One boy, Alfred, is in Lousiana and I don't
know what he's doin', but he's been married about five times. I have a
boy workin' in the post office in San Antonio named Mack, and the rest
of the chillen are here. There's Sarah, Riley, Frank, James, Banetta,
John, Theodore, Tommy, Annie Laurie. They all live here and work at
different places.


"I know when we used to camp out in the winter time we would have these
old-time freezes, when ever'thing was covered in ice. We would have a
big, fat cow hangin' up and we could slice that meat off and have the
best meals. And when we was on the cow hunts we would start out with
meal, salt and coffee and carry the beddin' for six or eight men on two
horses and carry our rations on another horse. I guess it would scare
people now to hear 'em comin' with all them pots and pans and makin' all
that racket.


"When we camped and killed a yearlin' the leaf fat and liver was one of
the first things we would cook. When they would start in to gather
cattle to send to Kansas, they would ride out in the herd and pick out a
fat calf, and they would get the 'fleece' and liver and broil the ribs.
The meat that was cut off the ribs was called the fleece. It was a
terr'ble waste, for many a time, the hams wasn't even cut out of the
hide, jes' left there. Old Man Alec Rutledge used to say, when they
would throw out bread and meat, he would say, 'I'll tell you, Tom, he
will have to walk alone sometimes because this willful waste will make
woeful wants.' He was talkin' about his brother--they was two of 'em and
sure 'nough, his brother finally lost all his cattle, quit the business,
and never had nothin' left. There would be an awful lot of good meat
wasted, and now we are payin' for it.


"The first fence I ever seen wasn't any larger then this addition here,
and it was put up out of pickets. The Mexicans used to build lots of
fences and we got the idea from them, mostly on these old-timey
stake-and-rider fences. It was an awful pasture when they had eight mile
of fence. The way they made the field fences was nothin' but brush. I
remember when I was a little fellow at John Kanady's (Kennedy's), George
Johnson would come over and stay with his sister, Mrs. Kanady, and he
would keep the cattle out of the field. One day, he came there and put
me on his horse. He had loosened up his girt, and I got out there a
little ways and one of the cows turned back. The horse was a regular old
cow pony and when that cow turned back, the old horse turned just as
quick and the saddle slipped and I stayed there.


"Oh, pshaw! they turn so quick you have to be on the lookout. You have
to watch the horse as well as the cow. Some of them horses get pretty
smart. One time they were cuttin' cattle and a fellow brought a cow to
the edge of the herd and the cow turned back and when she did, the horse
cut back too and left him there. When he went from under him, that
fellow's spurs left a mark clear across the saddle as he went over. It
was my saddle he was ridin' and that mark never did leave it, where the
spurs cut across it.


"We've done some ridin' even after my wife, here, and I were married.
She's seen 'em breakin' horses and all that pitchin' and bawlin'. But, I
never was no hand to show off. If I kep' my seat, that was all I wanted.
You see lots of fellows ridin' just to show off, but I never was for
anything like that.


"No, I never did go up on the trail. I've helped prepare the herd to
take. Usually, there would be one owner takin' his cattle up on the
trail. They had no place to hold the cattle, only under herd. Usually,
they would start with a thousand or fifteen hundred head, but they
didn't put 'em all together till they got away out on the divide. They
would have 'em shaped up as they gathered 'em and jes' hold what they
wanted to send. It didn't take so many men, either, because they all
understood their business.


"I was jes' thinkin' about when Mr. Demp Fenley and Rutledge was here.
They had about nine hundred head of cattle. We brought 'em right in
below Pearsall, right about the Shiner ranch, and delivered 'em there.
But before we got there at a little creek they called _Pato_, they was
hardly any place to bed the cattle because they was so much pear[TR:
cactus]. Mr. Rutledge and I always bedded the cattle down, and then I
would go on the last relief, usually about the time to get up, anyway.
He used me all the time when they would get ready to go to camp in the
evenin', and we'd spread 'em out and let 'em graze before beddin' 'em
down. Sometimes he would give me a motion to come over there, and I knew
that meant an animal to throw. He always got me to do the ropin' if one
broke out. Well, we was comin on with those cattle and they was a steer
that gave us trouble all the time. As soon as you got away, he would
walk out of the herd. Well, we got the cattle all bedded down and they
were quiet, but that steer walked out. I was ridin' Mr. Fenley's dun
horse, and Mr. Rutledge says to me, 'I tell you what we'll do. We'll
ketch that steer out here and give 'im a good whippin'.' I says, 'We'll
get into trouble, too.' Well, he was to hold 'im away from the herd and
I was to rope 'im, but the steer run in front of him and out-run 'im. If
he would have run in behind him, I would 'a caught 'im, but that steer
beat 'im to the herd and run right into the middle of 'em. And did he
stampede 'em! Those cattle run right into the camp, and the boys all
scramblin' into the wagon and gettin' on their horses without their
boots on. One steer fell and rolled right under the chuck wagon. You
know, we run those cattle all night, tryin' to hold 'em. It was a pear
flat there, and next mornin' that pear was all beat down flat on the
ground. They sure did run, and all because of that foolishness. Mr.
Rutledge got to me and told me not to tell it, and I don't reckin to
this day anybody knows what done that.


"I never told you about the panther about to get on to me, did I? Well,
we was out on the Rio Grande, about thirty-one or thirty-two miles
beyond Carrizo. It was at the _Las islas_ (The Islands) Crossin'. I was
about three days behind the outfit when they went out there. That was in
July, and they was a law passed that we had to quit wearin' our guns the
first day of July and hang 'em on the ho'n of our saddle. When I got to
the outfit, the boys was gettin' pretty tired herdin'. They had to bring
'em out about six miles to grass and to this little creek. We would put
'em in the pen at night and feed 'em hay. We were waitin' there for them
to deliver some cattle out of Mexico. The Mexican told me they was
somethin' out there where they were herdin' sheep that was scarin' the
sheep out of the pen at night. I had seen some bobcats, but I laid down
under one of these huisache trees and went to sleep. I had my pistol on
and was layin' there and about two o'clock, I woke up. I turned over and
rested myself on my elbow and looked off there about 12 feet from me and
there stood a big old female panther. She was kind of squattin' and
lookin' right at me. I reached right easy and got my Winchester that was
layin' beside me and I shot her right between the eyes. Why, I had one
of her claws here for a long time. She had some young ones somewhere. I
imagined, though, she was goin' to jump right on me. It wasn't no good
feelin', I know. She was an awful large one.


"Oh, my goodness! I have seen lobos, eight or ten in a bunch. They're
sure mean. I've seen 'em have cattle rounded up like a bunch of cow
hands. If you heard a cow or yearlin' beller at night, you could go next
mornin' and sure find where they had killed her. They would go right
into the cow or calf and eat its kidney fat first thing. I tell you, one
sure did scare me one time. I was out ridin', usually ropin' and
brandin' calves, and I came across a den in the ground. I heard
something whinin' down there in that hole. It was a curiosity to me and
I wanted to get one of those little wolf pups. That was what I thought
it was. I got down there and reached in there and got one of those
little fellows. They was lovos (lobos). They are usually gray, but he
was still black. They are black at first, then they turn gray. He was a
little bit of a fellow. Well, I got him out and the old lovo wolf run
right at me, snappin' her teeth, and my horse jerked back and came near
gettin' away. But I hung to my wolf and got to my horse and got on and
left there. I didn't have nothin' to kill her with. I was jes' a boy,
then. I took that pup and give it to Mrs. Jim Reedes, down on the Hondo,
and she kep' it till it began eatin' chickens.


"I had a bear scare, too. That was in '87, about fifty years ago. Well,
Ira Wheat was sheriff at Leakey in Edwards County, then. I went down
there, and I was ridin' a horse I broke for a sheriff in Kerr County. I
came to Leakey to see Wheat--you see they was burnin' cattle (running
the brands) all over that country then. As I was ridin' along, I seen
some buzzards and I rode out there. Somethin' had killed a hog and eat
on it. I knowed it was a bear afterwards, but then I went on down to
Leakey and started back, I got up on the divide, at the head of a little
canyon and I seen those buzzards again. I seen two black things and I
jes' thought to myself them buzzards was comin' back and eatin' on that
dead hog. I rode up and seen that it was two bears and I made a lunge at
'em and the old bear run off and the little cub ran up a tree. I
thought, 'I'll ketch you, you little rascal.' So I tied my horse and I
went up the tree after the cub and when I was near 'im, he squalled jes'
like a child. I tell you, when it squalled that way, here came that old
bear and begin snuffin' around the tree. My horse was jes' rearin' and
tryin' to break loose out there. I tell you, when I _did_ get down there
and get to him, I had to lead him about two hundred yards before I could
ever get on him. He sure was scared. Like it was when I was a boy down
on the Hondo one time and I could hear horses comin' and thought it was
Indians and after awhile, I couldn't hear nothin' but my heart beatin'."

Uncle Tom Mills is one of the most contented old darkies surviving the
good old days when range was open and a livelihood was the easiest thing
in the world to get. He lives in the western part of Uvalde, in a
four-room house that he built himself. A peach orchard and a grape arbor
shade the west side of the house. It is here that Uncle Tom spends many
hours cultivating his little garden patch. Contented and well-fed milk
cows lie in the shade of the oak trees in a little pasture east of the
house, and he proudly calls attention to their full udders and sleek
bodies. His wife, Hattie, laughs and joins him in conversation, helping
to prod his memory on minor events. He smiles a lot and seems optimistic
about most things. I did not hear him speak grudgingly toward anyone, or
make a complaint about the old-age pension he gets. He is always busy
about the place and claims that he can do a lot of work yet.








La San Mire




*La San Mire, 86, aged French Negro of the Pear Orchard Settlement, near
Beaumont, Texas, is alert and intelligent, and his long, well-formed
hands gesture while he talks. He was born in Abbeville Parish,
Louisiana, a slave of Prosper Broussard. His father was a Spaniard, his
mother spoke French, and his master was a Creole. La San's patois is
superior to that of the average French Negro. His story has been
translated.*


"The old war? No, I don't remember so much about it, because I was so
young. I was ten years old at the beginning of the war. I was born the
13th of May, but I do not know of what year, in the Parish of Abbeville,
on M'sieu Prosper's plantation between Abbeville and Crowley. My parents
were slaves. My father a Spaniard, who spoke Spanish and French. My
mother spoke French, the old master too, all Creoles. I, as all the
other slaves, spoke French.


"During the war all the children had fear. I drove an old ox-cart in
which I helped pick up the dead soldiers and buried them. A battle took
place about 40 miles from the plantation on a bluff near a large
ditch--not near the bayou, no. We were freed on July 4th. After the war
I remained with my old master. I worked in the house, cooked in the
kitchen. Early each morning, I made coffee and served it to my master
and his family while they were in the bed.


"The old master was mean--made slaves lie on the ground and whipped
them. I never saw him whip my father. He often whipped my mother. I'd
hide to keep from seeing this. I was afraid. Why did he whip them? I do
not remember. He did not have a prison, just 'coups de fault'
(beatings). But not one slave from our plantation tried to escape to the
north that I can remember.


"The slaves lived in little cabins. All alike, but good. One or two
beds. Rooms small as a kitchen. Chimneys of dirt. Good floors. We had
plenty to eat. Cornbread and grits, beef, 'chahintes'(coons), des rat
bois (possum), le couche-couche, and Irish and sweet potatoes.


"Everyone raised cotton. In the evenings the slave women and girls
seeded the cotton, carded it, made thread of it on the spinning wheel.
They made it into cotton for dresses and suits. No shoes or socks. In
winter the men might wear them in winter. Never the women or children.


"How many slaves? I do not recall. There were so many the yard was full.
They worked from sun-up to sundown, with one hour for dinner. School? I
hoed cotton and drove the oxen to plow the field.


"I never went to Mass before I was twenty years old. Yes, there were
churches and the others went, but I did not want to go. There were
benches especially for the slaves. Yes, I was baptized a Catholic in
Abbeville, when I was big.


"Sunday the Negro slaves had round dances. Formed a circle--the boys and
the girls--and changed partners. They sang and danced at the same time.
Rarely on Saturday they had the dances. They sang and whistled in the
fields.


"The marriages of the slaves were little affairs. Before the witnesses
they'd 'sauter le balais'--the two--and they were married. No
celebration, but always the little cakes.


"We had no doctor. We used 'vingaire' (an herb) for the fever; la
'chaspare' (sarsaparilla); la 'pedecha (an herb), sometimes called
L'absinthe amer, in a drink of whiskey or gin, for the fever. Des
regulateurs (patent medicines). On nearly all plantations there were
'traiteurs', (a charm-doctor, always a Negro).


"Noel we had the little cakes and special things to eat, but no
presents.

"I was married by the judge first, and after the marriage was blessed by
the priest. I was 21 years old. I wore a new suit, because I had some
money. I worked in the house during the day and at night I caught wild
horses and sold them. I remember my wedding day. It was the Saturday
before Mardi Gras. My wife came from Grand Chenier (Cameron) to
Abbeville when she was small. We had 16 children, 11 boys and five
girls. Three girls and two boys died when they were small.


"One year after my marriage I left the big house and made a home of my
own. For an enclosure I made a levee of earth around. I planted cotton.
I worked the place for a half or a third.


"I came to Beaumont 12 years ago, so my children could work, because I
was sick. I could no longer work."








Charley Mitchell




*Charley Mitchell, farmer in Panola Co., Texas, was born in 1852, a
slave of Nat Terry, an itinerant Baptist preacher of Lynchburg,
Virginia. Charley left the Terrys one year after he was freed. He worked
in a tobacco factory, then as a waiter, until 1887, when he moved to
Panola Co. For fifty years he has farmed in the Sabine River bottom,
about twenty-five miles southeast of Marshall, Texas.*


"I's born in Virginia, over in Lynchburg, and it was in 1852, and I
'longed to Parson Terry and Missy Julia. I don't 'member my pappy,
'cause he's sold when I's a baby, but my mammy was willed to the Terrys
and allus lived with them till freedom. She worked for them and they
hired her out there in town for cook and house servant.


"They hired me out most times as nuss for white folks chillen, and I
nussed Tom Thurman's chillen. He run the bakery there in Lynchburg and
come from the north, and when war broke they made him and 'nother
northener take a iron clad oath they wouldn't help the north. Durin' the
war I worked in Massa Thurman's bakery, helping make hard tack and
doughnuts for the 'federate sojers. He give me plenty to eat and wear
and treated me as well as I could hope for.


"Course, I didn't git no schoolin'. The white folks allus said niggers
don't need no larnin'. Some niggers larnt to write their initials on the
barn door with charcoal, then they try to find out who done that, the
white folks, I mean, and say they cut his fingers off iffen they jus'
find out who done it.


"Lynchburg was good sized when war come on and Woodruff's nigger tradin'
yard was 'bout the bigges' thing there. It was all fenced in and had a
big stand in middle of where they sold the slaves. They got a big price
for 'em and handcuffed and chained 'em together and led 'em off like
convicts. That yard was full of Louisiana and Texas slave buyers mos'
all the time. None of the niggers wanted to be sold to Louisiana, 'cause
that's where they beat 'em till the hide was raw, and salted 'em and
beat 'em some more.


"Course us slaves of white folks what lived in town wasn't treated like
they was on most plantations. Massa Nat and Missy Julia was good to us
and most the folks we was hired out to was good to us. Lynchburg was
full of pattyrollers, jus' like the country, though, and they had a
fenced in whippin' post there in town and the pattyrollers sho' put it
on a nigger iffen they cotch him without a pass.


"After war broke, Lee, you know General Lee himself, come to Lynchburg
and had a campground there and it look like 'nother town. The 'federates
had a scrimmage with the Yankees 'bout two miles out from Lynchburg, and
after surrender General Wilcox and a big company of Yankees come there.
De camp was clost to a big college there in Lynchburg and they throwed
up a big breastworks out the other side the college. I never seed it
till after surrender, 'cause us wasn't 'lowed to go out there. Gen.
Shumaker was commander of the 'Federate artillery and kilt the first
Yankee that come to Lynchburg. They drilled the college boys, too, there
in town. I didn't know till after surrender what they drilled them for,
'cause the white folks didn't talk the war 'mongst us.


"Bout a year after the Yankees come to Lynchburg they moved the cullud
free school out to Lee's Camp and met in one of the barracks and had
four white teachers from the north, and that school run sev'ral years
after surrender.


"Lots of 'Federate sojers passed through Lynchburg goin' to Petersburg.
Once some Yankee sojers come through clost by and there was a scrimmage
'tween the two armies, but it didn't last long. Gen. Wilcox had a
standin' army in Lynchburg after the war, when the Yankees took things
over, but everything was peaceful and quiet then.


"After surrender a man calls a meetin' of all the slaves in the
fairgrounds and tells us we's free. We wasn't promised anything. We jus'
had to do the best we could. But I heared lots of slaves what lived on
farms say they's promised forty acres and a mule but they never did git
it. We had to go to work for whatever they'd pay us, and we didn't have
nothing and no place to go when we was turned loose, but down the street
and road. When I left the Terry's I worked in a tobacco factory for a
dollar a week and that was big money to me. Mammy worked too and we
managed somehow to live.


"After I married I started farmin', but since I got too old I live round
with my chillen. I has two sons and a boy what I raised. One boy lives
clost to Jacksonville and the other in the Sabine bottom and the boy
what I raised lives at Henderson. I been gittin' $10.00 pension since
January this year. (1937)


"I never fool round with politics much. I's voted a few times, but most
the time I don't. I leaves that for folks what knows politics. I says
this, the young niggers ain't bein' raised like we was. Most of them
don't have no manners or no moral self-respect.




[Illustration: _Charley Mitchell_]




"I don't 'lieve much in hants but I's heared my wife call my name. She's
been dead four years. If you crave to see your dead folks, you'll never
see them, but if you don't think 'bout them they'll come back sometime.


"Two nigger women died in this house and both of them allus smoked a
pipe. My boy and me used to smell the pipes at night, since they died,
and one mornin' I seed one of them. I jus' happened to look out the
window and saw one of them goin' to the cow-pen. I knowed her by her
bonnet.


"They's a nigger church and cemetery up the road away from my house
where the dead folks come out by twos at night and go in the church and
hold service. Me and the preacher what preaches there done seed and
heared them.


"They's a way of keepin' off hants. That's done by tackin' an old shoe
by the side the door, or a horseshoe over the door, or pullin' off part
of the planks of your house and puttin' on some new boards."
