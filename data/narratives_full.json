        "age": "78",
        "address": "300 Odd Street",

        "text": "Rachel Adams' two-room, frame house is perched on the side of a steep\nhill where peach trees and bamboo form dense shade. Stalks of corn at\nthe rear of the dwelling reach almost to the roof ridge and a portion of\nthe front yard is enclosed for a chicken yard. Stepping gingerly around\nthe amazing number of nondescript articles scattered about the small\nveranda, the visitor rapped several times on the front door, but\nreceived no response. A neighbor said the old woman might be found at\nher son's store, but she was finally located at the home of a daughter.\n\n\nRachel came to the front door with a sandwich of hoecake and cheese in\none hand and a glass of water in the other. \"Dis here's Rachel Adams,\"\nshe declared. \"Have a seat on de porch.\" Rachel is tall, thin, very\nblack, and wears glasses. Her faded pink outing wrapper was partly\ncovered by an apron made of a heavy meal sack. Tennis shoes, worn\nwithout hose, and a man's black hat completed her outfit.\n\n\nRachel began her story by saying: \"Miss, dats been sich a long time back\ndat I has most forgot how things went. Anyhow I was borned in Putman\nCounty 'bout two miles from Eatonton, Georgia. My Ma and Pa was 'Melia\nand Iaaac Little and, far as I knows, dey was borned and bred in dat\nsame county. Pa, he was sold away from Ma when I was still a baby. Ma's\njob was to weave all de cloth for de white folks. I have wore many a\ndress made out of de homespun what she wove. Dere was 17 of us chillun,\nand I can't 'member de names of but two of 'em now--dey was John and\nSarah. John was Ma's onliest son; all de rest of de other 16 of us was\ngals.\n\n\n\"Us lived in mud-daubed log cabins what had old stack chimblies made out\nof sticks and mud. Our old home-made beds didn't have no slats or metal\nsprings neither. Dey used stout cords for springs. De cloth what dey\nmade the ticks of dem old hay mattresses and pillows out of was so\ncoarse dat it scratched us little chillun most to death, it seemed lak\nto us dem days. I kin still feel dem old hay mattresses under me now.\nEvvy time I moved at night it sounded lak de wind blowin' through dem\npeach trees and bamboos 'round de front of de house whar I lives now.\n\n\n\"Grandma Anna was 115 years old when she died. She had done wore herself\nout in slavery time. Grandpa, he was sold off somewhar. Both of 'em was\nfield hands.\n\n\n\"Potlicker and cornbread was fed to us chillun, out of big old wooden\nbowls. Two or three chillun et out of de same bowl. Grown folks had\nmeat, greens, syrup, cornbread, 'taters and de lak. 'Possums! I should\nsay so. Dey cotch plenty of 'em and atter dey was kilt ma would scald\n'em and rub 'em in hot ashes and dat clean't 'em jus' as pretty and\nwhite. OO-o-o but dey was good. Lord, Yessum! Dey used to go fishin' and\nrabbit huntin' too. Us jus' fotched in game galore den, for it was de\nstyle dem days. Dere warn't no market meat in slavery days. Seemed lak\nto me in dem days dat ash-roasted 'taters and groundpeas was de best\nsomepin t'eat what anybody could want. 'Course dey had a gyarden, and it\nhad somepin of jus' about evvything what us knowed anything 'bout in de\nway of gyarden sass growin' in it. All de cookin' was done in dem big\nold open fireplaces what was fixed up special for de pots and ovens.\nAshcake was most as good as 'taters cooked in de ashes, but not quite.\n\n\n\"Summertime, us jus' wore homespun dresses made lak de slips dey use for\nunderwear now. De coats what us wore over our wool dresses in winter was\nknowed as 'sacques' den, 'cause dey was so loose fittin'. Dey was heavy\nand had wool in 'em too. Marse Lewis, he had a plenty of sheep, 'cause\ndey was bound to have lots of warm winter clothes, and den too, dey\nlakked mutton to eat. Oh! dem old brogan shoes was coarse and rough.\nWhen Marse Lewis had a cow kilt dey put de hide in de tannin' vat. When\nde hides was ready, Uncle Ben made up de shoes, and sometimes dey let\nUncle Jasper holp him if dere was many to be made all at one time. Us\nwore de same sort of clothes on Sunday as evvyday, only dey had to be\nclean and fresh when dey was put on Sunday mornin'.\n\n\n\"Marse Lewis Little and his wife, Miss Sallie, owned us, and Old Miss,\nshe died long 'fore de surrender. Marse Lewis, he was right good to all\nhis slaves; but dat overseer, he would beat us down in a minute if us\ndidn't do to suit him. When dey give slaves tasks to do and dey warn't\ndone in a certain time, dat old overseer would whup 'em 'bout dat.\nMarster never had to take none of his Niggers to court or put 'em in\njails neither; him and de overseer sot 'em right. Long as Miss Sallie\nlived de carriage driver driv her and Marse Lewis around lots, but atter\nshe died dere warn't so much use of de carriage. He jus' driv for Marse\nLewis and piddled 'round de yard den.\n\n\n\"Some slaves larnt to read and write. If dey went to meetin' dey had to\ngo wid deir white folks 'cause dey didn't have no sep'rate churches for\nde Niggers 'til atter de war. On our Marster's place, slaves didn't go\noff to meetin' a t'all. Dey jus' went 'round to one another's houses and\nsung songs. Some of 'em read de Bible by heart. Once I heared a man\npreach what didn't know how to read one word in de Bible, and he didn't\neven have no Bible yit.\n\n\n\"De fust baptizin' I ever seed was atter I was nigh 'bout grown. If a\nslave from our place ever jined up wid a church 'fore de war was over, I\nnever heared tell nothin' 'bout it.\n\n\n\"Lordy, Miss! I didn't know nothin' 'bout what a funeral was dem days.\nIf a Nigger died dis mornin', dey sho' didn't waste no time a-puttin'\nhim right on down in de ground dat same day. Dem coffins never had no\nshape to 'em; dey was jus' squar-aidged pine boxes. Now warn't dat\nturrible?\n\n\n\"Slaves never went nowhar widout dem patterollers beatin' 'em up if dey\ndidn't have no pass.\n\n\n\"Dere was hunderds of acres in dat dere plantation. Marse Lewis had a\nheap of slaves. De overseer, he had a bugle what he blowed to wake up\nde slaves. He blowed it long 'fore day so dat dey could eat breakfast\nand be out dere in de fields waitin' for de sun to rise so dey could see\nhow to wuk, and dey stayed out dar and wukked 'til black dark. When a\nrainy spell come and de grass got to growin' fast, dey wukked dem slaves\nat night, even when de moon warn't shinin'. On dem dark nights one set\nof slaves helt lanterns for de others to see how to chop de weeds out of\nde cotton and corn. Wuk was sho' tight dem days. Evvy slave had a task\nto do atter dey got back to dem cabins at night. Dey each one hed to\nspin deir stint same as de 'omans, evvy night.\n\n\n\"Young and old washed deir clothes Sadday nights. Dey hardly knowed what\nSunday was. Dey didn't have but one day in de Christmas, and de only\ndiff'unce dey seed dat day was dat dey give 'em some biscuits on\nChristmas day. New Year's Day was rail-splittin' day. Dey was told how\nmany rails was to be cut, and dem Niggers better split dat many or\nsomebody was gwine to git beat up.\n\n\n\"I don't 'member much 'bout what us played, 'cept de way us run 'round\nin a ring. Us chillun was allus skeered to play in de thicket nigh de\nhouse 'cause Raw Head and Bloody Bones lived der. Dey used to skeer us\nout 'bout red 'taters. Dey was fine 'taters, red on de outside and\npretty and white on de inside, but white folks called 'em\n'nigger-killers.' Dat was one of deir tricks to keep us from stealin'\ndem 'taters. Dere wern't nothin' wrong wid dem 'taters; dey was jus' as\ngood and healthy as any other 'taters. Aunt Lucy, she was de cook, and\nshe told me dat slaves was skeered of dem 'nigger-killer' 'taters and\nnever bothered 'em much den lak dey does de yam patches dese days. I\nused to think I seed ha'nts at night, but it allus turned out to be\nsomebody dat was tryin' to skeer me.\n\n\n\"'Bout de most fun slaves had was at dem cornshuckin's. De general would\ngit high on top of de corn pile and whoop and holler down leadin' dat\ncornshuckin' song 'til all de corn was done shucked. Den come de big\neats, de likker, and de dancin'. Cotton pickin's was big fun too, and\nwhen dey got through pickin' de cotton dey et and drunk and danced 'til\ndey couldn't dance no more.\n\n\n\"Miss, white folks jus' had to be good to sick slaves, 'cause slaves was\nproperty. For Old Marster to lose a slave, was losin' money. Dere warn't\nso many doctors dem days and home-made medicines was all de go. Oil and\nturpentine, camphor, assfiddy (asafetida), cherry bark, sweetgum bark;\nall dem things was used to make teas for grown folks to take for deir\nailments. Red oak bark tea was give to chillun for stomach mis'ries.\n\n\n\"All I can ricollect 'bout de comin' of freedom was Old Marster tellin'\nus dat us was free as jack-rabbits and dat from den on Niggers would\nhave to git deir own somepin t'eat. It warn't long atter dat when dem\nyankees, wid pretty blue clothes on come through our place and dey stole\nmost evvything our Marster had. Dey kilt his chickens, hogs, and cows\nand tuk his hosses off and sold 'em. Dat didn't look right, did it?\n\n\n\"My aunt give us a big weddin' feast when I married Tom Adams, and she\nsho' did pile up dat table wid heaps of good eatments. My weddin' dress\nwas blue, trimmed in white. Us had six chillun, nine grandchillun, and\n19 great-grandchillun. One of my grandchillun is done been blind since\nhe was three weeks old. I sont him off to de blind school and now he kin\ngit around 'most as good as I kin. He has made his home wid me ever\nsince his Mammy died.\n\n\n\"'Cordin' to my way of thinkin', Abraham Lincoln done a good thing when\nhe sot us free. Jeff Davis, he was all right too, 'cause if him and\nLincoln hadn't got to fightin' us would have been slaves to dis very\nday. It's mighty good to do jus' as you please, and bread and water is\nheaps better dan dat somepin t'eat us had to slave for.\n\n\n\"I jined up wid de church 'cause I wanted to go to Heben when I dies,\nand if folks lives right dey sho' is gwine to have a good restin' place\nin de next world.

W.B. (Uncle Wash)\"; however,\nthis informant is different from the next informant, Rev. W.B. Allen.]\n\n\n\n\nThe story of \"Uncle Wash\", as he is familiarly known, is condensed as\nfollows:\n\n\nHe was born on the plantation of a Mr. Washington Allen of South\nCarolina, for whom he was named. This Mr. Allen had several sons and\ndaughters, and of these, one son--George Allen--who, during the 1850's\nleft his South Carolina home and settled near LaFayette, Alabama. About\n1858, Mr. Washington Allen died and the next year, when \"Wash\" was \"a\nfive-year old shaver\", the Allen estate in South Carolina was\ndivided--all except the Allen Negro slaves. These, at the instance and\ninsistence of Mr. George Allen, were taken to LaFayette, Alabama, to be\nsold. All were put on the block and auctioned off, Mr. George Allen\nbuying every Negro, so that not a single slave family was divided up.\n\n\n\"Uncle Wash\" does not remember what he \"fetched at de sale\", but he does\ndistinctly remember that as he stepped up on the block to be sold, the\nauctioneer ran his hand \"over my head and said: Genilmens, dis boy is\nas fine as split silk\". Then when Mr. George Allen had bought all the\nAllen slaves, it dawned upon them, and they appreciated, why he had\ninsisted on their being sold in Alabama, rather than in South Carolina.\n\n\nBefore he was six years of age, little \"Wash\" lost his mother and, from\nthen until freedom, he was personally cared for and looked after by Mrs.\nGeorge Allen; and the old man wept every time he mentioned her name.\n\n\nDuring the '60's, \"Uncle Wash's\" father drove a mail and passenger stage\nbetween Cusseta and LaFayette, Alabama--and, finally died and was buried\nat LaFayette by the side of his wife. \"Uncle Wash\" \"drifted over\" to\nColumbus about fifty years ago and is now living with his two surviving\nchildren.\n\n\nHe has been married four times, all his wives dying \"nachul\" deaths. He\nhas also \"buried four chillun\".\n\n\nHe was taught to read and write by the sons and daughters of Mr. George\nAllen, and attended church where a one-eyed white preacher--named Mr.\nTerrentine--preached to the slaves each Sunday \"evenin'\" (afternoon).\nThe salary of this preacher was paid by Mr. George Allen.\n\n\nWhen asked what this preacher usually preached about, \"Uncle Wash\"\nanswered: \"He was a one-eyed man an' couldn' see good; so, he mout\na'made some mistakes, but he sho tole us plenty 'bout hell fire 'n\nbrimstone.\"\n\n\n\"Uncle Wash\" is a literal worshipper of the memory of his \"old time\nwhite fokes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.R. Jones\n\n\nREV. W.B. ALLEN, EX-SLAVE\n425-Second Ave\nColumbus, Georgia\n(June 29, 1937)\n[JUL 28 1937]\n\n\n[TR: Original index refers to \"Allen, Rev. W.B. (Uncle Wash)\"; however,\nthis informant is different from the previous informant, Washington\nAllen, interviewed on Dec. 18, 1936. The previous interview for Rev.\nAllen that is mentioned below is not found in this volume.]\n\n\n\n\nIn a second interview, the submission of which was voluntarily sought by\nhimself, this very interesting specimen of a rapidly vanishing type\nexpressed a desire to amend his previous interview (of May 10, 1937) to\nincorporate the following facts:\n\n\n\"For a number of years before freedom, my father bought his time from\nhis master and traveled about over Russell County (Alabama) as a\njourneyman blacksmith, doing work for various planters and making good\nmoney--as money went in those days--on the side. At the close of the\nwar, however, though he had a trunk full of Confederate money, all of\nhis good money was gone.\n\n\nFather could neither read nor write, but had a good head for figures and\nwas very pious. His life had a wonderful influence upon me, though I was\noriginally worldly--that is, I drank and cussed, but haven't touched a\ndrop of spirits in forty years and quit cussing before I entered the\nministry in 1879.\n\n\nI learned to pray when very young and kept it up even in my unsaved\ndays. My white master's folks knew me to be a praying boy, and asked\nme--in 1865--when the South was about whipped and General Wilson was\nheaded our way--to pray to God to hold the Yankees back. Of course, I\ndidn't have any love for any Yankees--and haven't now, for that\nmatter--but I told my white folks straight-from-the-shoulder that I\n_could not_ pray along those lines. I told them flat-footedly that,\nwhile I loved them and would do any reasonable praying for them, I could\nnot pray against my conscience: that I not only wanted to be free, but\nthat I wanted to see all the Negroes freed!\n\n\nI then told them that God was using the Yankees to scourge the\nslave-holders just as He had, centuries before, used heathens and\noutcasts to chastise His chosen people--the Children of Israel.\"\n\n\n(Here it is to be noted that, for a slave boy of between approximately\n15 and 17 years of age, remarkable familiarity with the Old Testament\nwas displayed.)\n\n\nThe Parson then entered into a mild tirade against Yankees, saying:\n\n\n\"The only time the Northern people ever helped the Nigger was when they\nfreed him. They are not friends of the Negro and many a time, from my\npulpit, have I warned Niggers about going North. No, sir, the colored\nman doesn't belong in the North---has no business up there, and you may\ntell the world that the Reverend W.B. Allen makes no bones about saying\nthat! He also says that, if it wasn't for the influence of the white\nrace in the South, the Negro race would revert to savagery within a\nyear! Why, if they knew for dead certain that there was not a policeman\nor officer of the law in Columbus tonight, the good Lord only knows what\nthey'd do tonight\"!\n\n\nWhen the good Parson had delivered himself as quoted, he was asked a\nfew questions, the answers to which--as shall follow--disclose their\nnature.\n\n\n\"The lowest down Whites of slavery days were the average overseers. A\nfew were gentlemen, one must admit, but the regular run of them were\ntrash--commoner than the 'poor white trash'--and, if possible, their\nchildren were worse than their daddies. The name, 'overseer', was a\nsynonym for 'slave driver', 'cruelty', 'brutishness'. No, sir, a Nigger\nmay be humble and refuse to talk outside of his race--because he's\nafraid to, but you can't fool him about a white man!\n\n\nAnd you couldn't fool him when he was a slave! He knows a white man for\nwhat he is, and he knew him the same way in slavery times.\"\n\n\nConcerning the punishment of slaves, the Reverend said:\n\n\n\"I never heard or knew of a slave being tried in court for any thing. I\nnever knew of a slave being guilty of any crime more serious than taking\nsomething or violating plantation rules. And the only punishment that I\never heard or knew of being administered slaves was whipping.\n\n\nI have personally known a few slaves that were beaten to death for one\nor more of the following offenses:\n\n\n  Leaving home without a pass,\n\n\n  Talking back to--'sassing'--a white person,\n\n\n  Hitting another Negro,\n\n\n  Fussing, fighting, and rukkussing in the quarters,\n\n\n  Lying,\n\n\n  Loitering on their work,\n\n\n  Taking things--the Whites called it stealing.\n\n\n  Plantation rules forbade a slave to:\n\n\n  Own a firearm,\n\n\n  Leave home without a pass,\n\n\n  Sell or buy anything without his master's consent,\n\n\n  Marry without his owner's consent,\n\n\n  Have a light in his cabin after a certain hour at night,\n\n\n  Attend any secret meeting,\n\n\n  Harbor or [HW: in] any manner assist a runaway slave,\n\n\n  Abuse a farm animal,\n\n\n  Mistreat a member of his family, and do\n\n\n  A great many other things.\"\n\n\nWhen asked if he had ever heard slaves plot an insurrection, the Parson\nanswered in the negative.\n\n\nWhen asked if he had personal knowledge of an instance of a slave\noffering resistance to corporal punishment, the Reverend shook his head,\nbut said:\n\n\n\"Sometimes a stripped Nigger would say some hard things to the white man\nwith the strap in his hand, though he knew that he (the Negro) would pay\nfor it dearly, for when a slave showed spirit that way the master or\noverseer laid the lash on all the harder.\"\n\n\nWhen asked how the women took their whippings, he said:\n\n\n\"They usually screamed and prayed, though a few never made a sound.\"\n\n\nThe Parson has had two wives and five children. Both wives and three of\nhis children are dead. He is also now superannuated, but occasionally\ndoes a \"little preaching\", having only recently been down to Montezuma,\nGeorgia, on a special call to deliver a message to the Methodist flock\nthere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HW: Dist. 6\nEx-Slave #2]\nHenrietta Carlisle\n\n\nJACK ATKINSON--EX-SLAVE\nRt.

Ross\n\n\nEX TOWN SLAVE HANNAH AUSTIN\n[HW: about 75-85]\n[APR 8 1937]\n\n\n\n\nWhen the writer was presented to Mrs. Hannah Austin she was immediately\nimpressed with her alert youthful appearance. Mrs. Austin is well\npreserved for her age and speaks clearly and with much intelligence. The\ninterview was a brief but interesting one. This was due partly to the\nfact that Mrs. Austin was a small child when The Civil War ended and too\nbecause her family was classed as \"town slaves\" so classed because of\ntheir superior intelligence.\n\n\nMrs. Austin was a child of ten or twelve years when the war ended. She\ndoesn't know her exact age but estimated it to be between seventy and\nseventy five years. She was born the oldest child of Liza and George\nHall. Their master Mr. Frank Hall was very kind to them and considerate\nin his treatment of them.\n\n\nBriefly Mrs. Austin gave the following account of slavery as she knew\nit. \"My family lived in a two room well built house which had many\nwindows and a nice large porch. Our master, Mr. Hall was a merchant and\noperated a clothing store. Because Mr. Hall lived in town he did not\nneed but a few slaves. My family which included my mother, father,\nsister, and myself were his only servants. Originally Mr. Hall did not\nown any slaves, however after marrying Mrs. Hall we were given to her by\nher father as a part of her inheritance.\n\n\nMy mother nursed Mrs. Hall from a baby, consequently the Hall family was\nvery fond of her and often made the statement that they would not part\nwith her for anything in the world, besides working as the cook for the\nHall family my mother was also a fine seamstress and made clothing for\nthe master's family and for our family. We were allowed an ample amount\nof good clothing which Mr. Hall selected from the stock in his store. My\nfather worked as a porter in the store and did other jobs around the\nhouse. I did not have to work and spent most of my time playing with the\nHall children. We were considered the better class of slaves and did not\nknow the meaning of a hard time.\n\n\nOther slave owners whipped their slaves severely and often, but I have\nnever known our master to whip any one of my family. If any one in the\nfamily became ill the family doctor was called in as often as he was\nneeded.\n\n\nWe did not have churches of our own but were allowed to attend the white\nchurches in the afternoon. The White families attended in the forenoon.\nWe seldom heard a true religious sermon; but were constantly preached\nthe doctrine of obedience to our masters and mistresses. We were\nrequired to attend church every Sunday.\n\n\nMarriages were conducted in much the same manner as they are today.\nAfter the usual courtship a minister was called in by the master and the\nmarriage ceremony would then take place. In my opinion people of today\nare more lax in their attitude toward marriage than they were in those\ndays. Following the marriage of a slave couple a celebration would take\nplace often the master and his family would take part in the\ncelebration.\n\n\nI remember hearing my mother and father discuss the war; but was too\nyoung to know just the effect the war would have on the slave. One day I\nremember Mr. Hall coming to my mother telling her we were free. His\nexact words were quote--\"Liza you don't belong to me any longer you\nbelong to yourself. If you are hired now I will have to pay you. I do\nnot want you to leave as you have a home here as long as you live.\" I\nwatched my mother to see the effect his words would have on her and I\nsaw her eyes fill with tears. Mr. Hall's eyes filled with tears also.\n\n\nSoon after this incident a Yankee Army appeared in our village one day.\nThey practically destroyed Mr. Hall's store by throwing all clothes and\nother merchandise into the streets. Seeing my sister and I they turned\nto us saying, \"Little Negroes you are free there are no more masters and\nmistresses, here help yourselves to these clothes take them home with\nyou.\" Not knowing any better we carried stockings, socks, dresses,\nunderwear and many other pieces home. After this they opened the smoke\nhouse door and told us to go in and take all of the meat we wanted.\n\n\nOn another occasion the mistress called me asking that I come in the\nyard to play with the children\". Here Mrs. Austin began to laugh and\nremarked \"I did not go but politely told her I was free and didn't\nbelong to any one but my mama and papa. As I spoke these words my\nmistress began to cry.\n\n\nMy mother and father continued to live with the Halls even after freedom\nand until their deaths. Although not impoverished most of the Hall's\nfortune was wiped out with the war\".\n\n\nMrs. Austin married at the age of 16 years; and was the mother of four\nchildren, all of whom are dead. She was very ambitious and was\ndetermined to get an education if such was possible. After the war\nNorthern white people came south and set up schools for the education of\nNegroes. She remembers the organization of the old Storrs School from\nwhich one of the present Negroes Colleges originated.\n\n\nMrs. Austin proudly spoke of her old blue back speller, which she still\npossesses; and of the days when she attended Storrs School.\n\n\nAs the writer made ready to depart Mrs. Austin smilingly informed her\nthat she had told her all that she knew about slavery; and every word\nspoken was the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HW: Dist. 5\nEx Slave #1\nRoss]\n\n\n\"A FEW FACTS OF SLAVERY\"\nAs Told by CELESTIA AVERY--EX-SLAVE\n[MAY 8 1937]\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Celestia Avery is a small mulatto woman about 5 ft. in height. She\nhas a remarkably clear memory in view of the fact that she is about 75\nyears of age. Before the interview began she reminded the writer that\nthe facts to be related were either told to her by her grandmother,\nSylvia Heard, or were facts which she remembered herself.\n\n\nMrs. Avery was born 75 years ago in Troupe County, LaGrange, Ga. the\neighth oldest child of Lenora and Silas Heard. There were 10 other\nchildren beside herself. She and her family were owned by Mr. & Mrs.\nPeter Heard. In those days the slaves carried the surname of their\nmaster; this accounted for all slaves having the same name whether they\nwere kin or not.\n\n\nThe owner Mr. Heard had a plantation of about 500 acres and was\nconsidered wealthy by all who knew him. Mrs. Avery was unable to give\nthe exact number of slaves on the plantation, but knew he owned a large\nnumber. Cotton, corn, peas, potatoes, (etc.) were the main crops raised.\n\n\nThe homes provided for the slaves were two room log cabins which had one\ndoor and one window. These homes were not built in a group together but\nwere more or less scattered over the plantation. Slave homes were very\nsimple and only contained a home made table, chair and bed which were\nmade of the same type of wood and could easily be cleaned by scouring\nwith sand every Saturday. The beds were bottomed with rope which was run\nbackward and forward from one rail to the other. On this framework was\nplaced a mattress of wheat straw. Each spring the mattresses were\nemptied and refilled with fresh wheat straw.\n\n\nSlaves were required to prepare their own meals three times a day. This\nwas done in a big open fire place which was filled with hot coals. The\nmaster did not give them much of a variety of food, but allowed each\nfamily to raise their own vegetables. Each family was given a hand out\nof bacon and meal on Saturdays and through the week corn ash cakes and\nmeat; which had been broiled on the hot coals was the usual diet found\nin each home. The diet did not vary even at Christmas only a little\nfruit was added.\n\n\nEach family was provided with a loom and in Mrs. Avery's family, her\ngrandmother, Sylvia Heard, did most of the carding and spinning of the\nthread into cloth. The most common cloth for women clothes was homespun,\nand calico. This same cloth was dyed and used to make men shirts and\npants. Dye was prepared by taking a berry known as the shumake berry and\nboiling them with walnut peelings. Spring and fall were the seasons for\nmasters to give shoes and clothing to their slaves. Both men and women\nwore brogan shoes, the only difference being the piece in the side of\nthe womens.\n\n\nOne woman was required to do the work around the house there was also\none slave man required to work around the house doing odd jobs. Other\nthan these two every one else was required to do the heavy work in the\nfields. Work began at \"sun up\" and lasted until \"sun down\". In the\nmiddle of the day the big bell was rung to summon the workers from the\nfield, for their mid-day lunch. After work hours slaves were then free\nto do work around their own cabins, such as sewing, cooking (etc.)\n\n\n\"Once a week Mr. Heard allowed his slaves to have a frolic and folks\nwould get broke down from so much dancing\" Mrs. Avery remarked. The\nmusic was furnished with fiddles. When asked how the slaves came to own\nfiddles she replied, \"They bought them with money they earned selling\nchickens.\" At night slaves would steal off from the Heard plantation, go\nto LaGrange, Ga. and sell chickens which they had raised. Of course the\nmasters always required half of every thing raised by each slave and it\nwas not permissible for any slave to sell anything. Another form of\nentertainment was the quilting party. Every one would go together to\ndifferent person's home on each separate night of the week and finish\nthat person's quilts. Each night this was repeated until every one had a\nsufficient amount of covering for the winter. Any slave from another\nplantation, desiring to attend these frolics, could do so after securing\na pass from their master.\n\n\nMrs. Avery related the occasion when her Uncle William was caught off\nthe Heard plantation without a pass, and was whipped almost to death by\nthe \"Pader Rollers.\" He stole off to the depths of the woods here he\nbuilt a cave large enough to live in. A few nights later he came back to\nthe plantation unobserved and carried his wife and two children back to\nthis cave where they lived until after freedom. When found years later\nhis wife had given birth to two children. No one was ever able to find\nhis hiding place and if he saw any one in the woods he would run like a\nlion.\n\n\nMr. Heard was a very mean master and was not liked by any one of his\nslaves. Secretly each one hated him. He whipped unmercifully and in most\ncases unnecessarily. However, he sometimes found it hard to subdue some\nslaves who happened to have very high tempers. In the event this was the\ncase he would set a pack of hounds on him. Mrs. Avery related to the\nwriter the story told to her of Mr. Heard's cruelty by her grandmother.\nThe facts were as follows: \"Every morning my grandmother would pray, and\nold man Heard despised to hear any one pray saying they were only doing\nso that they might become free niggers. Just as sure as the sun would\nrise, she would get a whipping; but this did not stop her prayers every\nmorning before day. This particular time grandmother Sylvia was in\n\"family way\" and that morning she began to pray as usual. The master\nheard her and became so angry he came to her cabin seized and pulled her\nclothes from her body and tied her to a young sapling. He whipped her so\nbrutally that her body was raw all over. When darkness fell her husband\ncut her down from the tree, during the day he was afraid to go near her.\nRather than go back to the cabin she crawled on her knees to the woods\nand her husband brought grease for her to grease her raw body. For two\nweeks the master hunted but could not find her; however, when he finally\ndid, she had given birth to twins. The only thing that saved her was the\nfact that she was a mid-wife and always carried a small pin knife which\nshe used to cut the navel cord of the babies. After doing this she tore\nher petticoat into two pieces and wrapped each baby. Grandmother Sylvia\nlived to get 115 years old.\n\n\nNot only was Mr. Henderson cruel but it seemed that every one he hired\nin the capacity of overseer was just as cruel. For instance, Mrs.\nHenderson's grandmother Sylvia, was told to take her clothes off when\nshe reached the end of a row. She was to be whipped because she had not\ncompleted the required amount of hoeing for the day. Grandmother\ncontinued hoeing until she came to a fence; as the overseer reached out\nto grab her she snatched a fence railing and broke it across his arms.\nOn another occasion grandmother Sylvia ran all the way to town to tell\nthe master that an overseer was beating her husband to death. The master\nimmediately jumped on his horse and started for home; and reaching the\nplantation he ordered the overseer to stop whipping the old man. Mrs.\nAvery received one whipping, with a hair brush, for disobedience; this\nwas given to her by the mistress.\n\n\nSlaves were given separate churches, but the minister, who conducted the\nservices, was white. Very seldom did the text vary from the usual one of\nobedience to the master and mistress, and the necessity for good\nbehavior. Every one was required to attend church, however, the only\nself expression they could indulge in without conflict with the master\nwas that of singing. Any one heard praying was given a good whipping;\nfor most masters thought their prayers no good since freedom was the\nuppermost thought in every one's head.\n\n\nOn the Heard plantation as on a number of others, marriages were made by\nthe masters of the parties concerned. Marriage licenses were unheard of.\nIf both masters mutually consented, the marriage ceremony was considered\nover with. After that the husband was given a pass to visit his wife\nonce a week. In the event children were born the naming of them was left\nentirely to the master. Parents were not allowed to name them.\n\n\nHealth of slaves was very important to every slave owner for loss of\nlife meant loss of money to them. Consequently they would call in their\nfamily doctor, if a slave became seriously ill. In minor cases of\nillness home remedies were used. \"In fact,\" Mrs. Avery smilingly\nremarked, \"We used every thing for medicine that grew in the ground.\"\nOne particular home remedy was known as \"Cow foot oil\" which was made by\nboiling cow's feet in water. Other medicines used were hoarhound tea,\ncatnip tea, and castor oil. Very often medicines and doctors failed to\nsave life; and whenever a slave died he was buried the same day. Mrs.\nAvery remarked, \"If he died before dinner the funeral and burial usually\ntook place immediately after dinner.\"\n\n\nAlthough a very young child, Mrs. Avery remembers the frantic attempt\nslave owners made to hide their money when the war broke out. The\nfollowing is a story related concerning the Heard family. \"Mr. Heard,\nour master, went to the swamp, dug a hole, and hid his money, then he\nand his wife left for town on their horses. My oldest brother, Percy,\nsaw their hiding place; and when the Yanks came looking for the money,\nhe carried them straight to the swamps and showed than where the money\nwas hidden.\" Although the Yeard [TR: typo \"Heard\"] farm was in the\ncountry the highway was very near and Mrs. Avery told of the long army\nof soldiers marching to La Grange singing the following song: \"Rally\naround the flag boys, rally around the flag, joy, joy, for freedom.\"\nWhen the war ended Mr. Heard visited every slave home and broke the news\nto each family that they were free people and if they so desired could\nremain on his plantation. Mrs. Avery's family moved away, in fact most\nslave families did, for old man Heard had been such a cruel master\neveryone was anxious to get away from him. However, one year later he\nsold his plantation to Mr George Traylor and some of the families moved\nback, Mrs. Avery's family included.\n\n\nMrs. Avery married at the age of 16; and was the mother of 14 children,\nthree of whom are still living. Although she has had quite a bit of\nillness during her life, at present she is quite well and active in\nspite of her old age. She assured the writer that the story of slavery,\nwhich she had given her, was a true one and sincerely hoped it would do\nsome good in this world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLKLORE (Negro)\nMinnie B. Ross\n\n\n[MRS. CELESTIA AVERY]\n\n\n\n\nIn a small house at 173 Phoenix Alley, N.E. lives a little old woman\nabout 5 ft. 2 in. in height, who is an ex-slave. She greeted the writer\nwith a bright smile and bade her enter and have a seat by the small fire\nin the poorly lighted room. The writer vividly recalled the interview\nshe gave on slavery previously and wondered if any facts concerning\nsuperstitions, conjure, signs, etc. could be obtained from her. After a\nshort conversation pertaining to everyday occurrences, the subject of\nsuperstition was broached to Mrs. Avery. The idea amused her and she\ngave the writer the following facts: As far as possible the stories are\ngiven in her exact words. The interview required two days, November 30\nand December 2, 1936.\n\n\n\"When you see a dog lay on his stomach and slide it is a true sign of\ndeath. This is sho true cause it happened to me. Years ago when I lived\non Pine Street I was sitting on my steps playing with my nine-months old\nbaby. A friend uv mine came by and sat down; and as we set there a dog\nthat followed her began to slide on his stomach. It scared me; and I\nsaid to her, did you see that dog? Yes, I sho did. That night my baby\ndied and it wuzn't sick at all that day. That's the truth and a sho sign\nof death. Anudder sign of death is ter dream of a new-born baby. One\nnight not so long ago I dreamt about a new-born baby and you know I went\nter the door and called Miss Mary next door and told her I dreamed about\na new-born baby, and she said, Oh! that's a sho sign of death. The same\nweek that gal's baby over there died. It didn't surprise me when I heard\nit cause I knowed somebody round here wuz go die.\" She continued:\n\n\n\"Listen, child! If ebber you clean your bed, don't you never sweep off\nyour springs with a broom. Always wipe 'em with a rag, or use a brush.\nJest as sho as you do you see or experience death around you. I took my\nbed down and swept off my springs, and I jest happened to tell old Mrs.\nSmith; and she jumped up and said, 'Child, you ought not done that\ncause it's a sign of death.' Sho nuff the same night I lost another\nchild that wuz eight years old. The child had heart trouble, I think.\"\n\n\nMrs. Avery believes in luck to a certain extent. The following are\nexamples of how you may obtain luck:\n\n\n\"I believe you can change your luck by throwing a teaspoonful of sulphur\nin the fire at zackly 12 o'clock in the day. I know last week I was\nsitting here without a bit of fire, but I wuzn't thinking bout doing\nthat till a 'oman came by and told me ter scrape up a stick fire and put\na spoonful of sulphur on it; and sho nuff in a hour's time a coal man\ncame by and gave me a tub uv coal. Long time ago I used ter work fer\nsome white women and every day at 12 o'clock I wuz told ter put a\nteaspoonful of sulphur in the fire.\"\n\n\n\"Another thing, I sho ain't going ter let a 'oman come in my house on\nMonday morning unless a man done come in there fust. No, surree, if it\nseem lak one ain't coming soon, I'll call one of the boy chilluns, jest\nso it is a male. The reason fer this is cause women is bad luck.\"\n\n\nThe following are a few of the luck charms as described by Mrs. Avery:\n\n\n\"Black cat bone is taken from a cat. First, the cat is killed and\nboiled, after which the meat is scraped from the bones. The bones are\nthen taken to the creek and thrown in. The bone that goes up stream is\nthe lucky bone and is the one that should be kept.\" \"There is a boy in\nthis neighborhood that sells liquor and I know they done locked him up\nten or twelve times but he always git out. They say he carries a black\ncat bone,\" related Mrs. Avery.\n\n\n\"The Devil's shoe string looks jest like a fern with a lot of roots. My\nmother used to grow them in the corner of our garden. They are lucky.\n\n\n\"Majres (?) are always carried tied in the corner of a handkerchief. I\ndon't know how they make 'em.\n\n\n\"I bought a lucky stick from a man onct. It looked jest lak a candle,\nonly it wuz small; but he did have some sticks as large as candles and\nhe called them lucky sticks, too, but you had to burn them all night in\nyour room. He also had some that looked jest lak buttons, small and\nround.\"\n\n\nThe following are two stories of conjure told by Mrs. Avery:\n\n\n\"I knowed a man onct long ago and he stayed sick all der time. He had\nthe headache from morning till night. One day he went to a old man that\nwuz called a conjurer; this old man told him that somebody had stole the\nsweat-band out of his cap and less he got it back, something terrible\nwould happen. They say this man had been going with a 'oman and she had\nstole his sweat-band. Well, he never did get it, so he died.\n\n\n\"I had a cousin named Alec Heard, and he had a wife named Anna Heard.\nAnna stayed sick all der time almost; fer two years she complained. One\nday a old conjurer came to der house and told Alec that Anna wuz\npoisoned, but if he would give him $5.00 he would come back Sunday\nmorning and find the conjure. Alec wuz wise, so he bored a hole in the\nkitchen floor so that he could jest peep through there to der back\nsteps. Sho nuff Sunday morning the nigger come back and as Alec watched\nhim he dug down in the gound a piece, then he took a ground puppy, threw\nit in the hole and covered it up. All right, he started digging again\nand all at onct he jumped up and cried: 'Here 'tis! I got it.' 'Got\nwhat?' Alec said, running to the door with a piece of board. 'I got the\nground puppy dat wuz buried fer her.' Alec wuz so mad he jumped on that\nman and beat him most to death. They say he did that all the time and\nkept a lot of ground puppies fer that purpose.\" Continuing, she\nexplained that a ground puppy was a worm with two small horns. They are\ndug up out of the ground, and there is a belief that you will die if one\nbarks at you.\n\n\nMrs. Avery related two ways in which you can keep from being conjured by\nanyone.\n\n\n\"One thing I do every morning is ter sprinkle chamber-lye [HW: (urine)]\nwith salt and then throw it all around my door. They sho can't fix you\nif you do this. Anudder thing, if you wear a silver dime around your\nleg they can't fix you. The 'oman live next door says she done wore two\nsilver dimes around her leg for 18 years.\"\n\n\nNext is a story of the Jack O'Lantern.\n\n\n\"Onct when I wuz a little girl a lot of us chillun used to slip off and\ntake walnuts from a old man. We picked a rainy night so nobody would see\nus, but do you know it looked like a thousand Jack ma' Lanterns got in\nbehind us. They wuz all around us. I never will ferget my brother\ntelling me ter get out in the path and turn my pocket wrong side out. I\ntold him I didn't have no pocket but the one in my apron; he said,\n'well, turn that one wrong side out.' Sho nuff we did and they scattered\nthen.\"\n\n\nClosing the interview, Mrs. Avery remarked: \"That's bout all I know; but\ncome back some time and maybe I'll think of something else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRS. EMMALINE HEARD\n\n\n[TR: This interview, which was attached to the interview with Mrs.\nCelestia Avery, is also included in the second volume of the Georgia\nNarratives.]\n\n\n\n\nOn December 3 and 4, 1936, Mrs. Emmaline Heard was interviewed at her\nhome, 239 Cain Street. The writer had visited Mrs. Heard previously, and\nit was at her own request that another visit was made. This visit was\nsupposed to be one to obtain information and stories on the practice of\nconjure. On two previous occasions Mrs. Heard's stories had proved very\ninteresting, and I knew as I sat there waiting for her to begin that she\nhad something very good to tell me. She began:\n\n\n\"Chile, this story wuz told ter me by my father and I know he sho\nwouldn't lie. Every word of it is the trufe; fact, everything I ebber\ntold you wuz the trufe. Now, my pa had a brother, old Uncle Martin, and\nhis wife wuz name Julianne. Aunt Julianne used ter have spells and fight\nand kick all the time. They had doctor after doctor but none did her any\ngood. Somebody told Uncle Martin to go ter a old conjurer and let the\ndoctors go cause they wan't doing nothing fer her anyway. Sho nuff he\ngot one ter come see her and give her some medicine. This old man said\nshe had bugs in her head, and after giving her the medicine he started\nrubbing her head. While he rubbed her head he said: 'Dar's a bug in her\nhead; it looks jest like a big black roach. Now, he's coming out of her\nhead through her ear; whatever you do, don't let him get away cause I\nwant him. Whatever you do, catch him; he's going ter run, but when he\nhits the pillow, grab 'em. I'm go take him and turn it back on the one\nwho is trying ter send you ter the grave.' Sho nuff that bug drap out\nher ear and flew; she hollered, and old Uncle Martin ran in the room,\nsnatched the bed clothes off but they never did find him. Aunt Julianne\nnever did get better and soon she died. The conjurer said if they had a\ncaught the bug she would a lived.\"\n\n\nThe next story is a true story. The facts as told by Mrs. Heard were\nalso witnessed by her; as it deals with the conjuring of one of her\nsons. It is related in her exact words as nearly as possible.\n\n\n\"I got a son named Albert Heard. He is living and well; but chile, there\nwuz a time when he wuz almost ter his grave. I wuz living in town then,\nand Albert and his wife wuz living in the country with their two\nchillun. Well, Albert got down sick and he would go ter doctors, and go\nter doctors, but they didn't do him any good. I wuz worried ter death\ncause I had ter run backards and for'ards and it wuz a strain on me. He\nwuz suffering with a knot on his right side and he couldn't even fasten\nhis shoes cause it pained him so, and it wuz so bad he couldn't even\nbutton up his pants. A 'oman teached school out there by the name of\nMrs. Yancy; she's dead now but she lived right here on Randolph Street\nyears ago. Well, one day when I wuz leaving Albert's house I met her on\nthe way from her school. 'Good evening, Mrs. Heard,' she says. 'How is\nMr. Albert?' I don't hardly know, I says, cause he don't get no better.\nShe looked at me kinda funny and said, don't you believe he's hurt?' Yes\nmam, I said, I sho do. 'Well,' says she, 'I been wanting to say\nsomething to you concerning this but I didn't know how you would take\nit. If I tell you somewhere ter go will you go, and tell them I sent\nyou?' Yes mam, I will do anything if Albert can get better. 'All right\nthen', she says. 'Catch the Federal Prison car and get off at Butler\nSt.' In them days that car came down Forrest Ave. 'When you get to\nButler St.', she says, 'walk up to Clifton St. and go to such and such a\nnumber. Knock on the door and a 'oman by the name of Mrs. Hirshpath will\ncome ter the door. Fore she let you in she go ask who sent you there;\nwhen you tell 'er, she'll let you in. Now lemme tell you she keeps two\nquarts of whisky all the time and you have ter drink a little with her;\nsides that she cusses nearly every word she speaks; but don't let that\nscare you; she will sho get your son up if it kin be done.' Sho nuff\nthat old 'oman did jest lak Mrs. Yancy said she would do. She had a\nharsh voice and she spoke right snappy. When she let me in she said, sit\ndown. You lak whisky?' I said, well, I take a little dram sometimes.\n'Well, here take some of this', she said. I poured a little bit and\ndrank it kinda lak I wuz afraid. She cursed and said 'I ain't go conjure\nyou. Drink it.' She got the cards and told me to cut 'em, so I did.\nLooking at the cards, she said: 'You lak ter wait too long; they got him\nmarching to the cemetery. The poor thing! I'll fix those devils. (A\nprofane word was used instead of devils). He got a knot on his side,\nain't he?' Yes, Mam, I said. That 'oman told me everything that was\nwrong with Albert and zackly how he acted. All at once she said; 'If\nthem d----d things had hatched in him it would a been too late. If you\ndo zackly lak I tell you I'll get him up from there.' I sho will, I told\nher. 'Well, there's a stable sets east of his house. His house got three\nrooms and a path go straight to the stable. I see it there where he\nhangs his harness. Yes, I see it all, the devils! Have you got any\nmoney?' Yes, mam, a little, I said. 'All right then,' she said. 'Go to\nthe drug store and get 5\u00a2 worth of blue stone; 5\u00a2 wheat bran; and go ter\na fish market and ask 'em ter give you a little fish brine; then go in\nthe woods and get some poke-root berries. Now, there's two kinds of\npoke-root berries, the red skin and the white skin berry. Put all this\nin a pot, mix with it the guts from a green gourd and 9 parts of red\npepper. Make a poultice and put to his side on that knot. Now, listen,\nyour son will be afraid and think you are trying ter do something ter\nhim but be gentle and persuade him that its fer his good.' Child, he sho\ndid act funny when I told him I wanted to treat his side. I had ter tell\nhim I wuz carrying out doctors orders so he could get well. He reared\nand fussed and said he didn't want that mess on him. I told him the\ndoctor says you do very well till you go ter the horse lot then you go\nblind and you can't see. He looked at me. 'Sho nuff, Ma, he said, 'that\nsho is the trufe. I have ter always call one of the chillun when I go\nthere cause I can't see how ter get back ter the house.' Well, that\nconvinced him and he let me fix the medicine for him. I put him ter bed\nand made the poultice, then I put it ter his side. Now this 'oman said\nno one wuz ter take it off the next morning but me. I wuz suppose ter\nfix three, one each night, and after taking each one off ter bury it lak\ndead folks is buried, east and west, and ter make a real grave out of\neach one. Well, when I told him not ter move it the next morning, but\nlet me move it, he got funny again and wanted to know why. Do you know I\nhad ter play lak I could move it without messing up my bed clothes and\nif he moved it he might waste it all. Finally he said he would call me\nthe next morning. Sho nuff, the next morning he called me, ma! ma! come\ntake it off. I went in the room and he wuz smiling. I slept all night\nlong he said, and I feel so much better. I'm so glad, I said, and do you\nknow he could reach down and fasten up his shoe and it had been a long\ntime since he could do that. Later that day I slipped out and made my\nfirst grave under the fig bush in the garden. I even put up head boards,\ntoo. That night Albert said, 'Mama, fix another one. I feel so much\nbetter.' I sho will, I said. Thank God you're better; so fer three\nnights I fixed poultices and put ter his side and each morning he would\ntell me how much better he felt. Then the last morning I wuz fixing\nbreakfast and he sat in the next room. After while Albert jumped up and\nhollered, Ma! Ma!' What is it,' I said. 'Mama, that knot is gone. It\ndropped down in my pants.' What! I cried. Where is it? Chile, we looked\nbut we didn't find anything, but the knot had sho gone. Der 'oman had\ntold me ter come back when the knot moved and she would tell me what\nelse ter do. That same day I went ter see her and when I told her she\njust shouted, 'I fixed 'em, The devils! Now, says she, do you [TR:\nknow?] where you can get a few leaves off a yellow peachtree. It must be\na yellow peach tree, though. Yes, mam, I says to her. I have a yellow\npeachtree right there in my yard. Well, she says, get a handful of\nleaves, then take a knife and scrape the bark up, then make a tea and\ngive him so it will heal up the poison from that knot in his side, also\nmix a few jimson weeds with it. I come home and told him I wanted ter\ngive him a tea. He got scared and said, what fer, Ma? I had ter tell him\nI wuz still carrying out the doctor's orders. Well, he let me give him\nthe tea and that boy got well. I went back to Mrs. Hirshpath and told\nher my son was well and I wanted to pay her. Go on, she said, keep the\ndollar and send your chillun ter school. This sho happened ter me and I\nknow people kin fix you. Yes sir.\"\n\n\nThe next story was told to Mrs. Heard by Mrs. Hirshpath, the woman who\ncured her son.\n\n\nI used to go see that 'oman quite a bit and even sent some of my\nfriends ter her. One day while I wuz there she told me about this piece\nof work she did.\n\n\n\"There was a young man and his wife and they worked fer some white\nfolks. They had jest married and wuz trying ter save some money ter buy\na home with. All at onct the young man went blind and it almost run him\nand his wife crazy cause they didn't know what in the world ter do.\nWell, somebody told him and her about Mrs. Hirshpath, so they went ter\nsee her. One day, says Mrs. Hirshpath, a big fine carriage drew up in\nfront of her door and the coachman helped him to her door. She asked him\nwho sent him and he told her. She only charged 50\u00a2 for giving advice and\nafter you wuz cured it wuz up ter you to give her what you wanted to.\nWell, this man gave her 50\u00a2 and she talked ter him. She says, boy, you\ngo home and don't you put that cap on no more. What cap? he says. That\ncap you wears ter clean up the stables with, cause somebody done dressed\nthat cap fer you, and every time you perspire and it run down ter your\neyes it makes you blind. You jest get that cap and bring it ter me. I'll\nfix 'em; they's trying ter make you blind, but I go let you see. The boy\nwas overjoyed, and sho nuff he went back and brought her that cap, and\nit wuzn't long fore he could see good as you and me. He brought that\n'oman $50, but she wouldn't take but $25 and give the other $25 back ter\nhim.\n\n\n\"What I done told you is the trufe, every word of it; I know some other\nthings that happened but you come back anudder day fer that.\"",

A white cloth, tied turban\nfashion about her head, and gray cotton hose worn with black and white\nslippers that were run down at the heels, completed her costume.\n\n\n\"Good mornin'. Yessum, dis here's Georgia,\" was her greeting. \"Let's go\nin dar whar Ida is so us can set down. I don't know what you come for,\nbut I guess I'll soon find out.\"\n\n\nGeorgia was eager to talk but her articulation had been impaired by a\nparalytic stroke and at times it was difficult to understand her jumble\nof words. After observance of the amenities; comments on the weather,\nhealth and such subjects, she began:\n\n\n\"Whar was I born? Why I was born on de plantation of a great man. It was\nMarse Alec Stephens' plantation 'bout a mile and a half from\nCrawfordville, in Taliaferro County. Mary and Grandison Tilly was my Ma\nand Pa. Ma was cook up at de big house and she died when I was jus' a\nlittle gal. Pa was a field hand, and he belonged to Marse Britt Tilly.\n\n\n\"Dere was four of us chillun: me, and Mary, and Frances, and Mack,\" she\ncounted on the fingers of one hand. \"Marse Alec let Marse Jim Johnson\nhave Mack for his bodyguard. Frances, she wuked in de field, and Mary\nwas de baby--she was too little to wuk. Me, I was 14 years old when de\nwar was over. I swept yards, toted water to de field, and played 'round\nde house and yard wid de rest of de chillun.\n\n\n\"De long, log houses what us lived in was called \"shotgun\" houses 'cause\ndey had three rooms, one behind de other in a row lak de barrel of a\nshotgun. All de chillun slept in one end room and de grown folkses slept\nin de other end room. De kitchen whar us cooked and et was de middle\nroom. Beds was made out of pine poles put together wid cords. Dem\nwheat-straw mattresses was for grown folkses mostly 'cause nigh all de\nchillun slept on pallets. How-some-ever, dere was some few slave chillun\nwhat had beds to sleep on. Pillows! Dem days us never knowed what\npillows was. Gals slept on one side of de room and boys on de other in\nde chilluns room. Uncle Jim, he was de bed-maker, and he made up a heap\nof little beds lak what dey calls cots now.\n\n\n\"Becky and Stafford Stephens was my Grandma and Grandpa. Marse Alec\nbought 'em in Old Virginny. I don't know what my Grandma done 'cause she\ndied 'fore I was borned, but I 'members Grandpa Stafford well enough. I\ncan see him now. He was a old man what slept on a trundle bed in the\nkitchen, and all he done was to set by de fire all day wid a switch in\nhis hand and tend de chillun whilst dere mammies was at wuk. Chillun\nminded better dem days dan dey does now. Grandpa Stafford never had to\nholler at 'em but one time. Dey knowed dey would git de switch next if\ndey didn't behave.\n\n\n\"Now dere you is axin' 'bout dat somepin' t'eat us had dem days! Ida,\nain't dere a piece of watermelon in de ice box?\" Georgia lifted the lid\nof a small ice box, got out a piece of melon, and began to smack her\nthick lips as she devoured it with an air of ineffable satisfaction.\nWhen she had tilted the rind to swallow the last drop of pink juice, she\nindicated that she was fortified and ready to exercise her now well\nlubricated throat, by resuming her story:\n\n\n\"Oh, yessum! Marse Alec, had plenty for his slaves to eat. Dere was\nmeat, bread, collard greens, snap beans, 'taters, peas, all sorts of\ndried fruit, and just lots of milk and butter. Marse Alec had 12 cows\nand dat's whar I learned to love milk so good. De same Uncle Jim what\nmade our beds made our wooden bowls what dey kept filled wid bread and\nmilk for de chillun all day. You might want to call dat place whar Marse\nAlec had our veg'tables raised a gyarden, but it looked more lak a big\nfield to me, it was so big. You jus' ought to have seed dat dere\nfireplace whar dey cooked all us had to eat. It was one sho 'nough big\nsomepin, all full of pots, skillets, and ovens. Dey warn't never 'lowed\nto git full of smut neither. Dey had to be cleant and shined up atter\nevvy meal, and dey sho was pretty hangin' dar in dat big old fireplace.\n\n\n\"George and Mack was de hunters. When dey went huntin' dey brought back\njus' evvything: possums, rabbits, coons, squirrels, birds, and wild\nturkeys. Yessum, wild turkeys is some sort of birds I reckon, but when\nus talked about birds to eat us meant part'idges. Some folkses calls 'em\nquails. De fishes us had in summertime was a sight to see. Us sho et\ngood dem days. Now us jus' eats what-some-ever us can git.\n\n\n\"Summertime us jus' wore what us wanted to. Dresses was made wid full\nskirts gathered on to tight fittin' waisties. Winter clothes was good\nand warm; dresses made of yarn cloth made up jus' lak dem summertime\nclothes, and petticoats and draw's made out of osnaburg. Chillun what\nwas big enough done de spinnin' and Aunt Betsey and Aunt Tinny, dey wove\nmost evvy night 'til dey rung de bell at 10:00 o'clock for us to go to\nbed. Us made bolts and bolts of cloth evvy year.\n\n\n\"Us went bar'foots in summer, but bless your sweet life us had good\nshoes in winter and wore good stockin's too. It tuk three shoemakers for\nour plantation. Dey was Uncle Isom, Uncle Jim, and Uncle Stafford. Dey\nmade up hole-stock shoes for de 'omans and gals and brass-toed brogans\nfor de mens and boys.\n\n\n\"Us had pretty white dresses for Sunday. Marse Alec wanted evvybody on\nhis place dressed up dat day. He sont his houseboy, Uncle Harris, down\nto de cabins evvy Sunday mornin' to tell evvy slave to clean hisself up.\nDey warn't never give no chance to forgit. Dere was a big old room sot\naside for a wash-room. Folkses laughs at me now 'cause I ain't never\nstopped takin' a bath evvy Sunday mornin'.\n\n\n\"Marse Lordnorth Stephens was de boss on Marse Alec's plantation. Course\nMarse Alec owned us and he was our sho 'nough Marster. Neither one of\n'em ever married. Marse Lordnorth was a good man, but he didn't have no\nuse for 'omans--he was a sissy. Dere warn't no Marster no whar no better\ndan our Marse Alec Stephens, but he never stayed home enough to tend to\nthings hisself much 'cause he was all de time too busy on de outside. He\nwas de President or somepin of our side durin' de war.\n\n\n\"Uncle Pierce went wid Marse Alec evvy whar he went. His dog, Rio, had\nmore sense dan most folkses. Marse Alec, he was all de time havin' big\nmens visit him up at de big house. One time, out in de yard, him and one\nof dem 'portant mens got in a argyment 'bout somepin. Us chillun snuck\nup close to hear what dey was makin' such a rukus 'bout. I heared Marse\nAlec say: 'I got more sense in my big toe dan you is got in your whole\nbody.' And he was right--he did have more sense dan most folkses. Ain't\nI been a-tellin' you he was de President or somepin lak dat, dem days?\n\n\n\"Ma, she was Marse Alec's cook and looked atter de house. Atter she died\nMarse Lordnorth got Mrs. Mary Berry from Habersham County to keep house\nat de big house, but Aunt 'Liza, she done de cookin' atter Miss Mary got\ndar. Us little Niggers sho' did love Miss Mary. Us called her \"Mammy\nMary\" sometimes. Miss Mary had three sons and one of 'em was named Jeff\nDavis. I 'members when dey come and got him and tuk him off to war.\nMarse Lordnorth built a four-room house on de plantation for Miss Mary\nand her boys. Evvybody loved our Miss Mary, 'cause she was so good and\nsweet, and dere warn't nothin' us wouldn't have done for her.\n\n\n\"No Lord! Marse Lordnorth never needed no overseer or no carriage driver\nneither. Uncle Jim was de head man wat got de Niggers up evvy mornin'\nand started 'em off to wuk right. De big house sho was a pretty place,\na-settin' up on a high hill. De squirrels was so tame dar dey jus'\nplayed all 'round de yard. Marse Alec's dog is buried in dat yard.\n\n\n\"No Mam, I never knowed how many acres dere was in de plantation us\nlived on, and Marse Alec had other places too. He had land scattered\nevvywhar. Lord, dere was a heap of Niggers on dat place, and all of us\nwas kin to one another. Grandma Becky and Grandpa Stafford was de fust\nslaves Marse Alec ever had, and dey sho had a passel of chillun. One\nthing sho Marse Lordnorth wouldn't keep no bright colored Nigger on dat\nplantation if he could help it. Aunt Mary was a bright colored Nigger\nand dey said dat Marse John, Marse Lordnorth's brother, was her Pa, but\nanyhow Marse Lordnorth never had no use for her 'cause she was a bright\ncolored Nigger.\n\n\n\"Marse Lordnorth never had no certain early time for his slaves to git\nup nor no special late time for 'em to quit wuk. De hours dey wuked was\n'cordin' to how much wuk was ahead to be done. Folks in Crawfordville\ncalled us 'Stephens' Free Niggers.'\n\n\n\"Us minded Marse Lordnorth--us had to do dat--but he let us do pretty\nmuch as us pleased. Us never had no sorry piece of a Marster. He was a\ngood man and he made a sho 'nough good Marster. I never seed no Nigger\ngit a beatin', and what's more I never heared of nothin' lak dat on our\nplace. Dere was a jail in Crawfordville, but none of us Niggers on Marse\nAlec's place warn't never put in it.\n\n\n\"No Lord! None of us Niggers never knowed nothin' 'bout readin' and\nwritin'. Dere warn't no school for Niggers den, and I ain't never been\nto school a day in my life. Niggers was more skeered of newspapers dan\ndey is of snakes now, and us never knowed what a Bible was dem days.\n\n\n\"Niggers never had no churches of deir own den. Dey went to de white\nfolkses' churches and sot in de gallery. One Sunday when me and my\nsister Frances went to church I found 50\u00a2 in Confederate money and\nshowed it to her. She tuk it away from me. Dat's de onliest money I seed\ndurin' slavery time. Course you knows dey throwed Confederate money away\nfor trash atter de war was over. Den us young chaps used to play wid it.\n\n\n\"I never went to no baptizin's nor no funerals neither den. Funerals\nwarn't de style. When a Nigger died dem days, dey jus' put his body in a\nbox and buried it. I 'members very well when Aunt Sallie and Aunt\nCatherine died, but I was little den, and I didn't take it in what dey\ndone bout buryin' 'em.\n\n\n\"None of Marse Alec's slaves never run away to de North, 'cause he was\nso good to 'em dey never wanted to leave him. De onliest Nigger what\nleft Marse Alec's place was Uncle Dave, and he wouldn't have left 'cept\nhe got in trouble wid a white 'oman. You needn't ax me her name 'cause I\nain't gwine to tell it, but I knows it well as I does my own name.\nAnyhow Marse Alec give Uncle Dave some money and told him to leave, and\nnobody never seed him no more atter dat.\n\n\n\"Oh yessum! Us heared 'bout 'em, but none of us never seed no\npatterollers on Marse Alec's plantation. He never 'lowed 'em on his\nland, and he let 'em know dat he kept his slaves supplied wid passes\nwhenever dey wanted to go places so as dey could come and go when dey\ngot good and ready. Thursday and Sadday nights was de main nights dey\nwent off. Uncle Stafford's wife was Miss Mary Stephen's cook, Uncle\nJim's wife lived on de Finley place, and Uncle Isom's belonged to de\nHollises, so dey had regular passes all de time and no patterollers\nnever bothered 'em none.\n\n\n\"Whenever Marse Alec or Marse Lordnorth wanted to send a message dey\njus' put George or Mack on a horse and sont 'em on but one thing sho,\ndere warn't no slave knowed what was in dem letters.\n\n\n\"Marse Alec sho had plenty of mules. Some of 'em was named: Pete, Clay,\nRollin, Jack, and Sal. Sal was Allen's slow mule, and he set a heap of\nstore by her. Dere was a heap more mules on dat place, but I can't call\nback dere names right now.\n\n\n\"Most times when slaves went to deir quarters at night, mens rested, but\nsometimes dey holped de 'omans cyard de cotton and wool. Young folkses\nfrolicked, sung songs, and visited from cabin to cabin. When dey got\nbehind wid de field wuk, sometimes slaves wuked atter dinner Saddays,\nbut dat warn't often. But, Oh, dem Sadday nights! Dat was when slaves\ngot together and danced. George, he blowed de quills, and he sho could\nblow grand dance music on 'em. Dem Niggers would jus' dance down. Dere\nwarn't no foolishment 'lowed atter 10:00 o'clock no night. Sundays dey\nwent to church and visited 'round, but folks didn't spend as much time\ngaddin' 'bout lak dey does now days.\n\n\n\"Christmas Day! Oh, what a time us Niggers did have dat day! Marse\nLordnorth and Marse Alec give us evvything you could name to eat: cake\nof all kinds, fresh meat, lightbread, turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese,\nand all kinds of wild game. Dere was allus plenty of pecans, apples, and\ndried peaches too at Christmas. Marse Alec had some trees what had fruit\ndat looked lak bananas on 'em, but I done forgot what was de name of dem\ntrees. Marse Alec would call de grown folkses to de big house early in\nde mornin' and pass 'round a big pewter pitcher full of whiskey, den he\nwould put a little whiskey in dat same pitcher and fill it wid sweetened\nwater and give dat to us chillun. Us called dat 'toddy' or 'dram'. Marse\nAlex allus had plenty of good whiskey, 'cause Uncle Willis made it up\nfor him and it was made jus' right. De night atter Christmas Day us\npulled syrup candy, drunk more liquor, and danced. Us had a big time for\na whole week and den on New Year's Day us done a little wuk jus' to\nstart de year right and us feasted dat day on fresh meat, plenty of\ncake, and whiskey. Dere was allus a big pile of ash-roasted 'taters on\nhand to go wid dat good old baked meat. Us allus tried to raise enough\n'taters to last all through de winter 'cause Niggers sho does love dem\nsweet 'taters. No Mam, us never knowed nothin' 'bout Santa Claus 'til\natter de war.\n\n\n\"No Mam, dere warn't no special cornshuckin's and cotton pickin's on\nMarse Alec's place, but of course dey did quilt in de winter 'cause dere\nhad to be lots of quiltin' done for all dem slaves to have plenty of\nwarm kivver, and you knows, Lady, 'omens can quilt better if dey gits a\npassel of 'em together to do it. Marse Alec and Marse Lordnorth never\n'lowed dere slaves to mix up wid other folkses business much.\n\n\n\"Oh Lord! Us never played no games in slavery times, 'cept jus' to run\naround in a ring and pat our hands. I never sung no songs 'cause I\nwarn't no singer, and don't talk 'bout no Raw Head and Bloody Bones or\nnothin' lak dat. Dey used to skeer us chillun so bad 'bout dem sort of\nthings dat us used to lay in bed at night a-shakin' lak us was havin'\nchills. I've seed plenty of ha'nts right here in Athens. Not long atter\nI had left Crawfordville and moved to Athens, I had been in bed jus' a\nlittle while one night, and was jus' dozin' off to sleep when I woke up\nand sot right spang up in bed. I seed a white man, dressed in white,\nstandin' before me. I sho didn't say nothin' to him for I was too\nskeered. De very last time I went to a dance, somepin got atter me and\nskeered me so my hair riz up 'til I couldn't git my hat on my haid, and\ndat cyored me of gwine to dances. I ain't never been to no more sich\ndoin's.\n\n\n\"Old Marster was powerful good to his Niggers when dey got sick. He had\n'em seed atter soon as it was 'ported to him dat dey was ailin'. Yessum,\ndere warn't nothin' short 'bout our good Marsters, 'deed dere warn't!\nGrandpa Stafford had a sore laig and Marse Lordnorth looked atter him\nand had Uncle Jim dress dat pore old sore laig evvy day. Slaves didn't\ngit sick as often as Niggers does now days. Mammy Mary had all sorts of\nteas made up for us, 'cordin' to whatever ailment us had. Boneset tea\nwas for colds. De fust thing dey allus done for sore throat was give us\ntea made of red oak bark wid alum. Scurvy grass tea cleant us out in the\nspringtime, and dey made us wear little sacks of assfiddy (asafetida)\n'round our necks to keep off lots of sorts of miseries. Some folkses\nhung de left hind foot of a mole on a string 'round deir babies necks to\nmake 'em teethe easier. I never done nothin' lak dat to my babies 'cause\nI never believed in no such foolishment. Some babies is jus' natchelly\ngwine to teethe easier dan others anyhow.\n\n\n\"I 'members jus' as good as if it was yesterday what Mammy Mary said\nwhen she told us de fust news of freedom. 'You all is free now,' she\nsaid. 'You don't none of you belong to Mister Lordnorth nor Mister Alec\nno more, but I does hope you will all stay on wid 'em, 'cause dey will\nallus be jus' as good to you as dey has done been in de past.' Me, I\nwarn't even studyin' nothin' 'bout leavin' Marse Alec, but Sarah Ann and\nAunt Mary, dey threwed down deir hoes and jus' whooped and hollered\n'cause dey was so glad. When dem Yankees come to our place Mammy Mary\naxed 'em if dey warn't tired of war. 'What does you know 'bout no war?'\nDey axed her right back. 'No, us won't never git tired of doin' good.'\n\n\n\"I stayed on wid my two good Marsters 'til most 3 years atter de war,\nand den went to wuk for Marse Tye Elder in Crawfordville. Atter dat I\nwuked for Miss Puss King, and when she left Crawfordville I come on here\nto Athens and wuked for Miss Tildy Upson on Prince Avenue. Den I went to\nAtlanta to wuk for Miss Ruth Evage (probably Elliott). Miss Ruth was a\nniece of Abraham Lincoln's. Her father was President Lincoln's brother\nand he was a Methodist preacher what lived in Mailpack, New York. I went\nevvywhar wid Miss Ruth. When me and Miss Ruth was in Philadelphia, I got\nsick and she sont me home to Athens and I done been here wid my daughter\never since.\n\n\n\"Lawdy, Miss! I ain't never been married, but I did live wid Major Baker\n18 years and us had five chillun. Dey is all daid but two. Niggers\ndidn't pay so much 'tention to gittin' married dem days as dey does now.\nI stays here wid my gal, Ida Baker. My son lives in Cleveland, Ohio. My\nfust child was borned when I warn't but 14 years old. De war ended in\nApril and she was borned in November of dat year. Now, Miss! I ain't\nnever told but one white 'oman who her Pa was, so you needn't start\naxin' me nothin' 'bout dat. She had done been walkin' evvywhar 'fore she\ndied when she was jus' 10 months old and I'm a-tellin' you de truth\nwhen I say she had more sense dan a heap of white chillun has when dey\nis lots older dan she was. Whilst I was off in New York wid Miss Ruth,\nMajor, he up and got married. I reckon he's daid by now. I don't keer\nnohow, atter de way he done me. I made a good livin' for Major 'til he\nmarried again. I seed de 'oman he married once.\n\n\n\"Yes Mam,\" there was strong emphasis in this reply. \"I sho would ruther\nhave slavery days back if I could have my same good Marsters 'cause I\nnever had no hard times den lak I went through atter dey give us\nfreedom. I ain't never got over not bein' able to see Marse Alec no\nmore. I was livin' at Marse Tye Elder's when de gate fell on Marse Alec,\nand he was crippled and lamed up from dat time on 'til he died. He got\nto be Governor of Georgia whilst he was crippled. When he got hurt by\ndat gate, smallpox was evvywhar and dey wouldn't let me go to see 'bout\nhim. Dat most killed me 'cause I did want to go see if dere was somepin'\nI could do for him.\n\n\n\"Lordy Mussy, Miss! I had a time jinin' up wid de church. I was in\nMailpack, New York, wid Miss Ruth when I had de urge to jine up. I told\nMiss Ruth 'bout it and she said: 'Dere ain't no Baptist church in 10\nmiles of here.' 'Lord, have mussy!' I said. 'Miss Ruth, what I gwine do?\nDese is all Methodist churches up here and I jus' can't jine up wid no\nMethodists.' 'Yes you can,' she snapped at me, 'cause my own Pa's\na-holdin a 'vival in dis very town and de Methodist church is de best\nanyhow.' Well, I went on and jined de Reverend Lincoln's Methodist\nchurch, but I never felt right 'bout it. Den us went to Philadelphia and\nsoon as I could find a Baptist church dar, I jined up wid it. Northern\nchurches ain't lak our southern churches 'cause de black and white\nfolkses all belong to de same church dar and goes to church together. On\ndat account I still didn't feel lak I had jined de church. Bless your\nsweet life, Honey, when I come back to de South, I was quick as I could\nbe to jine up wid a good old southern Baptist church. I sho didn't mean\nto live outdoors, 'specially atter I dies.\" Georgia's eyes sparkled and\nher flow of speech was smooth as she told of her religious experiences.\nWhen that subject was exhausted her eyes dimmed again and her speech\nbecame less articulate.\n\n\nGeorgia's reeking pipe had been laid aside for the watermelon and not\nlong after that was consumed the restless black fingers sought\noccupation sewing gay pieces for a quilt. \"Miss, I warn't born to be\nlazy, I warn't raised dat way, and I sho ain't skeered to die.\n\n\n\"Good-bye, Honey,\" said Georgia, as the interviewer arose and made her\nway toward the street. \"Hurry back and don't forgit to fetch me dat\npurty pink dress you is a-wearin'. I don't lak white dresses and I ain't\nnever gwine to wear a black one nohow.\"\n\n\n\n\n[TR: Return Visit]\n\n\nGeorgia was on the back porch washing her face and hands and quarrelling\nwith Ida for not having her breakfast ready at nine-thirty when the\ninterviewer arrived for a re-visit.\n\n\n\"Come in,\" Georgia invited, \"and have a cheer. But, Miss I done told you\nall I knows 'bout Marse Alec and dem deys when I lived on his\nplantation. You know chillun den warn't 'lowed to hang 'round de grown\nfolks whar dey could hear things what was talked about.\"\n\n\nAbout this time Ida came down from a second-floor kitchen with her\nmother's breakfast. She was grumbling a little louder on each step of\nthe rickety stairway. \"Lord, have mussy! Ma is still a-talkin' 'bout dat\nold slavery stuff, and it ain't nothin' nohow.\" After Ida's eyes had\nrested on the yellow crepe frock just presented Georgia in appreciation\nof the three hours she had given for the first interview, she became\nreconciled for the story to be resumed, and even offered her assistance\nin rousing the recollections of her parent.\n\n\n\"Did I tell you\" Georgia began, \"dat de man what looked atter Marse\nAlec's business was his fust cousin? He was de Marse Lordnorth I'se all\ntime talkin' 'bout, and Marse John was Marse Lordnorth's brother. Dere\nwarn't no cook or house gal up at de big house but Ma 'til atter she\ndied, and den when Miss Mary Berry tuk charge of de house dey made\nUncle Harry and his wife, Aunt 'Liza, house boy and cook.\n\n\n\"Marse Alec growed all his corn on his Googer Crick plantation. He\nplanned for evvything us needed and dere warn't but mighty little dat he\ndidn't have raised to take keer of our needs. Lordy, didn't I tell you\nwhat sort of shoes, holestock shoes is? Dem was de shoes de 'omans wore\nand dey had extra pieces on de sides so us wouldn't knock holes in 'em\ntoo quick.\n\n\n\"De fust time I ever seed Marse Alec to know who he was, I warn't more'n\n6 years old. Uncle Stafford had went fishin' and cotched de nicest mess\nof fish you ever seed. He cleant 'em and put 'em in a pan of water, and\ntold me to take 'em up to de big house to Marse Alec. I was skeered when\nI went in de big house yard and axed, what looked lak a little boy, whar\nMarse Alec was, and I was wuss skeered when he said: 'Dis is Marse Alec\nyou is talkin' to. What you want?' I tole him Uncle Stafford sont him de\nfishes and he told me: 'Take 'em to de kitchen and tell 'Liza to cook\n'em for me.' I sho ain't never gwine to forgit dat.\n\n\n\"One day dey sont me wid a bucket of water to de field, and I had to go\nthrough de peach orchard. I et so many peaches, I was 'most daid when I\ngot back to de house. Dey had to drench me down wid sweet milk, and from\ndat day to dis I ain't never laked peaches. From den on Marse Alec\ncalled me de 'peach gal.'\n\n\n\"Marse Alec warn't home much of de time, but when he was dar he used to\nwalk down to de cabins and laugh and talk to his Niggers. He used to\nsing a song for de slave chillun dat run somepin lak dis:\n\n\n  'Walk light ladies\n   De cake's all dough,\n   You needn't mind de weather,\n   If de wind don't blow.'\"\n\n\nGeorgia giggled when she came to the end of the stanza. \"Us didn't know\nwhen he was a-singin' dat tune to us chillun dat when us growed up us\nwould be cake walkin' to de same song.\n\n\n\"On Sundays, whenever Marse Alec was home, he done lots of readin' out\nof a great big old book. I didn't know what it was, but he was pow'ful\nbusy wid it. He never had no parties or dancin' dat I knows 'bout, but\nhe was all time havin' dem big 'portant mens at his house talkin' 'bout\nde business what tuk him off from home so much. I used to see Lawyer\nCoombs dere heaps of times. He was a big, fine lookin' man. Another big\nlawyer was all time comin' dar too, but I done lost his name. Marse Alec\nhad so awful much sense in his haid dat folkses said it stunted his\ngrowin'. Anyhow, long as he lived he warn't no bigger dan a boy.\n\n\n\"When Uncle Harry's and Aunt 'Liza's daughter what was named 'Liza, got\nmarried he was in Washin'ton or some place lak dat. He writ word to\nMarse Linton, his half-brother, to pervide a weddin' for her. I knows\n'bout dat 'cause I et some of dat barbecue. Dat's all I 'members 'bout\nher weddin'. I done forgot de name of de bridegroom. He lived on some\nother plantation. Aunt 'Liza had two gals and one boy. He was named\nAllen.\n\n\n\"Whilst Marse Alec was President or somepin, he got sick and had to come\nback home, and it wern't long atter dat 'fore de surrender. Allen was\n'pinted to watch for de blue coats. When dey come to take Marse Alec\noff, dey was all over the place wid deir guns. Us Niggers hollered and\ncried and tuk on pow'ful 'cause us sho thought dey was gwine to kill him\non account of his bein' such a high up man on de side what dey was\nfightin'. All de Niggers followed 'em to de depot when dey tuk Marse\nAlec and Uncle Pierce away. Dey kept Marse Alec in prison off somewhar a\nlong time but dey sont Pierce back home 'fore long.\n\n\n\"I seed Jeff Davis when dey brung him through Crawfordville on de train.\nDey had him all fastened up wid chains. Dey told me dat a Nigger 'oman\nput pizen in Jeff Davis' somepin t'eat and dat was what kilt him. One\nthing sho, our Marse Alec warn't pizened by nobody. He was comin' from\nde field one day when a big old heavy gate fell down on him, and even if\nhe did live a long time atterwards dat was what was de cause of his\ndeath.\n\n\n\"I seed Uncle Pierce 'fore he died and us sot and talked and cried 'bout\nMarse Alec.

Now, Miss, I done told you all I can ricollec'\n'bout dem days. I thanks you a lot for dat purty yaller dress, and I\nhopes you comes back to see me again sometime.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALICE BATTLE, EX-SLAVE\nHawkinsville, Georgia\n\n\n(Interviewed By Elizabeth Watson--1936)\n[JUL 20, 1937]\n\n\n\n\nDuring the 1840's, Emanuel Caldwell--born in North Carolina, and Neal\nAnne Caldwell--born in South Carolina, were brought to Macon by\n\"speculators\" and sold to Mr. Ed Marshal of Bibb County. Some time\nthereafter, this couple married on Mr. Marshal's plantation, and their\nsecond child, born about 1850, was Alice Battle. From her birth until\nfreedom, Alice was a chattel of this Mr. Marshal, whom she refers to as\na humane man, though inclined to use the whip when occasion demanded.\n\n\nFollowed to its conclusion, Alice's life history is void of thrills and\nsimply an average ex-slave's story. As a slave, she was well fed, well\nclothed, and well treated, as were her brother and sister slaves. Her\nmother was a weaver, her father--a field hand, and she did both\nhousework and plantation labor.\n\n\nAlice saw the Yankee pass her ex-master's home with their famous\nprisoner, Jeff Davis, after his capture, in '65. The Yankee band, says\nshe, was playing \"We'll hang Jeff Davis on a Sour Apple Tree\". Some of\nthe soldiers \"took time out\" to rob the Marshal smokehouse. The Whites\nand Negroes were all badly frightened, but the \"damyankees didn't harm\nnobody\".\n\n\nAfter freedom, Alice remained with the Marshals until Christmas, when\nshe moved away. Later, she and her family moved back to the Marshal\nplantation for a few years. A few years still later, Alice married a\nBattle \"Nigger\".\n\n\nSince the early '70's, Alice has \"drifted around\" quite a bit. She and\nher husband are now too old and feeble to work. They live with one of\ntheir sons, and are objects of charity.",

        "text": "The shade of the large water oaks in Jasper's yard was a welcome sight\nwhen the interviewer completed the long walk to the old Negro's place in\nthe sweltering heat of a sunny July afternoon. The old house appeared to\nbe in good condition and the yard was clean and tidy. Jasper's wife,\nLula, came around the side of the house in answer to the call for\nJasper. A large checked apron almost covered her blue dress and a clean\nwhite headcloth concealed her hair. Despite her advanced age, she seemed\nto be quite spry.\n\n\n\"Jus' come back here whar I'se a-doin' de white folks' washin',\" she\nsaid. \"Jasper's done been powerful sick and I can't leave him by hisself\nnone. I brung him out here in de shade so I could watch him and 'tend to\nhim whilst I wuks. Jasper stepped on a old plank what had two rusty\nnails in it, and both of 'em went up in his foot a fur ways. I done driv\ndem nails plumb up to dey haids in de north side of a tree and put\njimpson weed poultices on Jasper's foot, but it's still powerful bad\noff.\"\n\n\nBy this time we had arrived within sight and earshot of the old rocking\nchair where Jasper sat with his foot propped high in another chair. His\nchair had long ago been deprived of its rockers. The injured member\nappeared to be swollen and was covered with several layers of the\njimpson weed leaves. The old man's thin form was clothed in a faded blue\nshirt and old gray cotton trousers. His clothes were clean and his\nwhite hair was in marked contrast to his shining but wrinkled black\nface. He smiled when Lula explained the nature of the proposed\ninterview. \"'Scuse me, Missy,\" he apologized, \"for not gittin' up,\n'cause I jus' can't use dis old foot much, but you jus' have a seat here\nin de shade and rest yourself.\" Lula now excused herself, saying: \"I\njus' got to hurry and git de white folks' clothes washed and dried 'fore\nit rains,\" and she resumed her work in the shade of another huge tree\nwhere a fire was burning brightly under her washpot and a row of\nsud-filled tubs occupied a long bench.\n\n\n\"Lula, she has to wuk all de time,\" Jasper explained, \"and she don't\nnever have time to listen to me talk. I'se powerful glad somebody is\nwillin' to stop long enough to pay some heed whilst I talks 'bout\nsomepin. Dem days 'fore de war was good old days, 'specially for de\ncolored folks. I know, 'cause my Mammy done told me so. You see I was\nmighty little and young when de war was over, but I heared de old folks\ndo lots of talkin' 'bout dem times whilst I was a-growin' up, and den\ntoo, I stayed right dar on dat same place 'til I was 'bout grown. It was\nMarse Henry Jones' plantation 'way off down in Taliaferro County, nigh\nCrawfordville, Georgy. Mammy b'longed to Marse Henry. She was Harriet\nJones. Daddy was Simon Battle and his owner was Marse Billie Battle. De\nBattle's plantation was off down dar nigh de Jones' place. When my Mammy\nand Daddy got married Marse Henry wouldn't sell Mammy, and Marse Billie\nwouldn't sell Daddy, so dey didn't git to see one another but twice a\nweek--dat was on Wednesday and Sadday nights--'til atter de war was done\nover. I kin still 'member Daddy comin' over to Marse Henry's plantation\nto see us.\n\n\n\"Marse Henry kept a lot of slaves to wuk his big old plantation whar he\ngrowed jus' evvything us needed to eat and wear 'cept sugar and coffee\nand de brass toes for our home-made, brogan shoes. Dere allus was\na-plenty t'eat and wear on dat place.\n\n\n\"Slave quarters was log cabins built in long rows. Some had chimblies in\nde middle, twixt two rooms, but de most of 'em was jus' one-room cabins\nwid a stick and mud chimbly at de end. Dem chimblies was awful bad 'bout\nketchin' on fire. Didn't nobody have no glass windows. Dey jus' had\nplain plank shutters for blinds and de doors was made de same way, out\nof rough planks. All de beds was home-made and de best of 'em was\ncorded. Dey made holes in de sides and foots and haidpieces, and run\nheavy home-made cords in dem holes. Dey wove 'em crossways in and out of\ndem holes from one side to another 'til dey had 'em ready to lay de\nmattress mat on. I'se helped to pull dem cords tight many a time. Our\nmattress ticks was made of homespun cloth and was stuffed wid wheat\nstraw. 'Fore de mattress tick was put on de bed a stiff mat wove out of\nwhite oak splits was laid on top of de cords to pertect de mattress and\nmake it lay smooth. Us was 'lowed to pick up all de old dirty cotton\n'round de place to make our pillows out of.\n\n\n\"Jus' a few of de slave famblies was 'lowed to do deir own cookin'\n'cause Marster kept cooks up at de big house what never had nothin' else\nto do but cook for de white folks and slaves. De big old fireplace in\ndat kitchen at de big house was more dan eight feet wide and you could\npile whole sticks of cord-wood on it. It had racks acrost to hang de\npots on and big ovens and little ovens and big, thick, iron fryin' pans\nwid long handles and hefty iron lids. Dey could cook for a hunderd\npeople at one time in dat big old kitchen easy. At one time dere was\ntables acrost one end of de kitchen for de slaves t'eat at, and de slave\nchillun et dar too.\n\n\n\"Marster was mighty good to slave chillun. He never sont us out to wuk\nin de fields 'til us was 'most growed-up, say 12 or 14 years old. A\nNigger 12 or 14 years old dem days was big as a white child 17 or 18\nyears old. Why Miss, Niggers growed so fast, dat most of de Nigger\nnurses warn't no older dan de white chillun dey tuk keer of. Marster\nsaid he warn't gwine to send no babies to de fields. When slave chillun\ngot to be 'bout 9 or 10 years old dey started 'em to fetchin' in wood\nand water, cleanin' de yards, and drivin' up de cows at night. De\nbigges' boys was 'lowed to measure out and fix de stock feed, but de\nmost of us chillun jus' played in de cricks and woods all de time.\nSometimes us played Injuns and made so much fuss dat old Aunt Nancy\nwould come out to de woods to see what was wrong, and den when she found\nus was jus' a-havin' fun, she stropped us good for skeerin' her.\n\n\n\"Mammy's job was to make all de cloth. Dat was what she done all de\ntime; jus' wove cloth. Some of de others cyarded de bats and spun\nthread, but Mammy, she jus' wove on so reg'lar dat she made enough cloth\nfor clothes for all dem slaves on de plantation and, it's a fact, us did\nhave plenty of clothes. All de nigger babies wore dresses made jus' alak\nfor boys and gals. I was sho'ly mighty glad when dey 'lowed me to git\nrid of dem dresses and wear shirts. I was 'bout 5 years old den, but dat\nboys' shirt made me feel powerful mannish. Slave gals wore homespun\ncotton dresses, and dey had plenty of dem dresses, so as dey could keep\nnice and clean all de time. Dey knitted all de socks and stockin's for\nwinter. Dem gals wore shawls, and dere poke bonnets had ruffles 'round\n'em. All de shoes was home-made too. Marster kept one man on de\nplantation what didn't do nothin' but make shoes. Lordy, Missy! What\nwould gals say now if dey had to wear dem kind of clothes? Dey would\nraise de roof plumb offen de house. But jus' let me tell you, a purty\nyoung gal dressed in dem sort of clothes would look mighty sweet to me\nright now.\n\n\n\"Us never could eat all de meat in Marster's big old smokehouse.\nSometimes he tuk hams to de store and traded 'em for sugar and coffee.\nPlenty of 'bacco was raised on dat plantation for all de white folks and\nde growed-up Niggers. Slave chillun warn't sposen to have none, so us\nhad to swipe what 'bacco us got. If our Mammies found out 'bout us\ngittin' 'bacco, dey stropped us 'til de skin was most off our backs, but\nsometimes us got away wid a little. If us seed any of de old folks was\nwatchin' us, us slipped de 'bacco from one to another of us whilst dey\ns'arched us, and it went mighty bad on us if dey found it.\n\n\n\"Slaves went to de white folks' church and listened to de white\npreachers. Dere warn't no colored preacher 'lowed to preach in dem\nchurches den. Dey preached to de white folks fust and den dey let de\ncolored folks come inside and hear some preachin' atter dey was through\nwid de white folks. But on de big 'vival meetin' days dey 'lowed de\nNiggers to come in and set in de gallery and listen at de same time dey\npreached to de white folks. When de sermon was over dey had a big dinner\nspread out on de grounds and dey had jus' evvything good t'eat lak\nchickens, barbecued hogs and lambs, pies, and lots of watermelons. Us\nkept de watermelons in de crick 'til dey was ready to cut 'em. A white\ngentleman, what dey called Mr. Kilpatrick, done most of de preachin'. He\nwas from de White Plains neighborhood. He sho' did try mighty hard to\ngit evvybody to 'bey de Good Lord and keep his commandments.\n\n\n\"Mr. Kilpatrick preached all de funerals too. It 'pears lak a heap more\nfolks is a-dyin' out dese days dan died den, and folks was a heap better\nden to folks in trouble. Dey would go miles and miles den when dey\ndidn't have no auto'biles, to help folks what was in trouble. Now, dey\nwon't go next door when dere's death in de house. Den, when anybody died\nde fust thing dey done was to shroud 'em and lay 'em out on de coolin'\nboard 'til Old Marster's cyarpenter could git de coffin made up. Dere\nwarn't no embalmers dem days and us had to bury folks de next day atter\ndey died. De coffins was jus' de same for white folks and deir slaves.\nOn evvy plantation dere was a piece of ground fenced in for a graveyard\nwhar dey buried white folks and slaves too. My old Daddy is buried down\nyonder on Marse Henry's plantation right now.\n\n\n\"When a slave wanted to git married up wid a gal, he didn't ax de gal,\nbut he went and told Marster 'bout it. Marster would talk to de gal and\nif she was willin', den Marster would tell all de other Niggers us was\na-goin' to have a weddin'. Dey would all come up to de big house and\nMarster would tell de couple to jine hands and jump backwards over a\nbroomstick, and den he pernounced 'em man and wife. Dey didn't have to\nhave no licenses or nothin' lak dey does now. If a man married up wid\nsomebody on another place, he had to git a pass from his Marster, so as\nhe could go see his wife evvy Wednesday and Sadday nights. When de\npatterollers cotched slaves out widout no passes, dey evermore did beat\n'em up. Leastways dat's what Mammy told me.\n\n\n\"Durin' de big war all de white folkses was off a-fightin' 'cept dem\nwhat was too old to fight or what was too bad crippled and 'flicted. Dey\nstayed home and looked atter de 'omans and chillun. Somebody sont\nMist'ess word dat dem yankees was on de way to our plantation and she\nhid evvything she could, den had de hogs and hosses driv off to de\nswamps and hid. Mammy was crazy 'bout a pet pig what Marster had done\ngive her, so Mist'ess told her to go on down to dat swamp quick, and\nhide dat little pig. Jus' as she was a-runnin' back in de yard, dem\nyankees rid in and she seed 'em a-laughin' fit to kill. She looked\n'round to see what dey was tickled 'bout and dere followin' her lak a\nbaby was dat pig. Dem yankees was perlite lak, and dey never bothered\nnothin' on our place, but dey jus' plumb ruint evvything on some of de\nplantations right close to our'n. Dey tuk nigh evvything some of our\nneighbors had t'eat, most all deir good hosses, and anything else dey\nwanted. Us never did know why dey never bothered our white folkses'\nthings.\n\n\n\"When dey give us our freedom us went right on over to Marse Billie\nBattle's place and stayed dar wid Daddy 'bout a year; den Daddy come wid\nus back to Marse Henry's, and dar us stayed 'til Old Marster died. Long\nas he lived atter de war, he wukked most of his help on sheers, and seed\ndat us was tuk keer of jus' lak he had done when us all b'longed to him.\nUs never went to school much 'cause Mammy said white folks didn't lak\nfor Niggers to have no larnin', but atter de war was done over our Old\nMist'ess let colored chillun have some lessons in a little cabin what\nwas built in de back yard for de white chillun to go to school in.\n\n\n\"Atter dey buried our Old Marster, us moved down to Hancock County and\nfarmed dar, 'cause dat was all us knowed how to do. Us got together and\nraised money to buy ground enough for a churchyard and a graveyard for\ncolored folks. Dat graveyard filled up so fast dat dey had to buy more\nland several times. Us holped 'em build de fust colored church in\nHancock County.\n\n\n\"School for colored chillun was held den in our church house. Our\nteacher was a white man, Mr. Tom Andrews, and he was a mighty good\nteacher, but Lordy, how strick he was! Dese here chillun don't know\nnothin' 'bout school. Us went early in de mornin', tuk our dinner in a\nbucket, and never left 'til four o'clock, and sometimes dat was 'most\nnigh sundown. All day us studied dat blue back speller, and dat white\nteacher of ours sho' tuk de skin offen our backs if us didn't mind him.\nDere warn't no fussin' and fightin' and foolin' 'round on de way home,\n'cause dat white teacher 'lowed he had control of us 'til us got to our\nMammies' doors and if us didn't git for home in a hurry, it was jus' too\nbad for us when he tuk it out on us next day wid dat long hick'ry\nswitch.\n\n\n\"Things is sho' diffunt now. Folks ain't good now as dey was den, but\ndere is gwine to be a change. I may not be here to see it, but it's\na-comin' 'cause de Good Lord is done 'sied (prophesied) it, and it's got\nto be. God's sayin' is comin' to pass jus' as sho' as us is livin' and\nsettin' in de shade of dis here tree.\n\n\n\"Lordy, Miss! How come you axes 'bout colored folks'es weddin's? I was\na-courtin' a little 14-year old gal named Lovie Williams, but her Mammy\nrunned me off and said she warn't gwine to let Lovie git married up wid\nnobody 'til she got big enough. I jus' bought dem licenses and watched\nfor my chanct and den I stole dat gal right from under her Mammy's eyes.\nMy Mammy knowed all 'bout it and holped us git away. Us didn't have no\ntime for no weddin'. De best us could do was jus' to git ourselfs\nmarried up. Lovie's Mammy raised de Old Ned, but us didn't keer den,\n'cause it was too late for her to do nothin' to part us. Lovie was one\nof the bestest gals what ever lived. Us raised 12 chillun and I never\nhad one speck of trouble wid her. Lovie's done been daid 15 years now.\"\n\n\nHis voice trembled as he talked about his first wife, and Lula almost\nstopped her work to listen. This kind of talk did not please her and her\nexpression grew stern. \"You done talked a-plenty,\" she told him. \"You\nain't strong 'nough to do no more talkin',\" but Jasper was not willing\nto be silenced. \"I reckon I knows when I'se tired. I ain't gwine to hush\n'til I gits good and ready,\" was his protest. \"Yes Missy,\" he continued.\n\"All our chillun is done daid now 'cept four and dey is 'way off up\nNorth. Ain't nobody left here 'cept me and Lula. Lula is pow'ful good to\nme. I done got too old to wuk, and can't do nothin' nohow wid dis old\nfoot so bad off. I'se ready and even anxious to go when de Good Lord\ncalls for old Jasper to come to de Heav'nly Home.\n\n\n\"I ain't heared nothin' from my only brother in over 7 years. I 'spose\nhe still lives in Crawfordville. Missy, I wishes I could go back down to\nCrawfordville one more time. I kin jus' see our old homeplace on de\nplantation down dar now. Lula a-washin' here, makes me study 'bout de\nold washplace on Marse Henry's plantation. Dere was a long bench full of\nold wood tubs, and a great big iron pot for bilin' de clothes, and de\nbatten block and stick. Chillun beat de clothes wid de batten stick and\nkept up de fire 'round de pot whilst de 'omans leaned over de tubs\nwashin' and a-singin' dem old songs. You could hear 'em 'most a mile\naway. Now and den one of de 'omans would stop singin' long enough to\nyell at de chillun to 'git more wood on dat fire 'fore I lash de skin\noffen your back.'\n\n\n\"Oh Missy, dem was good old days. Us would be lucky to have 'em back\nagain, 'specially when harvest time comes 'round. You could hear Niggers\na-singin' in de fields 'cause dey didn't have no worries lak dey got\nnow. When us got de corn up from de fields, Niggers come from far and\nnigh to Marster's cornshuckin'. Dat cornshuckin' wuk was easy wid\nevvybody singin' and havin' a good time together whilst dey made dem\nshucks fly. De cornshuckin' captain led all de singin' and he set right\nup on top of de highes' pile of corn. De chillun was kept busy a-passin'\nde liquor jug 'round. Atter it started gittin' dark, Marster had big\nbonfires built up and plenty of torches set 'round so as dere would be\nplenty of light. Atter dey et all dey wanted of dem good things what had\ndone been cooked up for de big supper, den de wrastlin' matches started,\nand Marster allus give prizes to de best wrastlers. Dere warn't no\nfussin' and fightin' 'lowed on our place, and dem wrastlin' matches was\nall in good humor and was kept orderly. Marster wanted evvybody to be\nfriends on our plantation and to stay dat way, for says he: 'De Blessed\nSaviour done said for us to love our neighbor as ourselfs, and to give\nand what us gives is gwine to come back to us.' Missy, de Good Lord's\nword is always right.\"\n\n\nThe interviewer was preparing to leave when one of Jasper's old friends\napproached the sheltering tree in the yard, where the interview was\ndrawing to a close. \"Brudder Paul,\" said Jasper, \"I wisht you had come\nsooner 'cause Missy, here, and me is done had de bestes' time a-goin'\nback over dem old times when folks loved one another better dan dey does\nnow. Good-bye Missy, you done been mighty kind and patient wid old\nJasper. Come back again some time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HW: Dist. --\nEx-Slv. #10]\n\n\nARRIE BINNS OF WASHINGTON-WILKES\n\n\nby\nMinnie Branham Stonestreet\nWashington-Wilkes\nGeorgia\n[MAY 8 1937]\n\n\n\n\nArrie Binns lives in Baltimore, a negro suburb of Washington-Wilkes, in\na little old tumbled down kind of a cottage that used to be one of the\nneatest and best houses of the settlement and where she has lived for\nthe past sixty-odd years. In the yard of her home is one of the most\nbeautiful holly trees to be found anywhere. She set it there herself\nover fifty years ago. She recalled how her friends predicted bad luck\nwould befall her because she \"sot out er holly\", but not being in the\nleast bit superstitious she paid them \"no mind\" and has enjoyed her\nbeautiful tree all these years. Many lovely oaks are around her house;\nshe set them there long ago when she was young and with her husband\nmoved into their new home and wanted to make it as attractive as\npossible. She is all alone now. Her husband died some years ago and\nthree of her four children have passed on. Her \"preacher son\" who was\nher delight, died not very long ago. All this sorrow has left Aunt Arrie\nold and sad; her face is no longer lighted by the smile it used to know.\nShe is a tiny little scrap of a woman with the softest voice and is as\nneat as can be. She wears an oldfashioned apron all the time and in cool\nweather there is always a little black cape around her frail shoulders\nand held together with a plain old gold \"breastpin\".\n\n\nShe was born in Lincoln County (Georgia), her mother was Emeline Sybert\nand her father Jordan Sybert. They belonged to Mr. Jones Sybert and his\nwife \"Miss Peggy\". After freedom they changed their surname to Gullatt\nas they liked that better. Arrie was among the oldest of nine children.\nThe night she was born the stork brought a little baby girl to the home\nof a white family just across the creek from the Syberts. The little\nwhite girl was named Arine so \"Miss Peggy\" named the little new black\nbaby girl Arrie, and that is how it happened she was given such an odd\nname.\n\n\nArrie said she was \"15 or 16 years old when the war broke (1865), I wuz\nbig enough to be lookin' at boys an' dey lookin' at me.\" She remembers\nthe days of war, how when the battle of Atlanta was raging they heard\nthe distant rumble of cannon, and how \"upsot\" they all were. Her master\ndied of \"the consumption\" during the war. She recalls how hard it was\nafter his death. The Syberts had no children and there was no one to\nturn to after his death. Arrie tells of her Master's illness, how she\nwas the housemaid and was called upon to fan him and how she would get\nso tired and sleepy she would nod a little, the fan dropping from hands\ninto his face. He would take it up and \"crack my haid with the handle to\nwake me up. I wuz allus so sorry when I done that, but I jest had ter\nnod.\"\n\n\nShe told about how bad the overseers were and the trouble they gave\nuntil finally \"old Miss turned off ther one she had an' put my Pa in his\nplace to manage things and look after the work.\" Arrie was never\npunished, (not any more than having her head cracked by her Master when\nshe nodded while fanning him.) \"No mam, not none of our niggers wuz\nwhipped. Why I recollect once, my brother wuz out without a pass an' de\npatter rollers kotch him and brung him to old Miss and said he'd have\nter be whipped, old Miss got so mad she didn't know what ter do, she\nsaid nobody wuz a goin' ter whip her niggers, but the patter roller men\n'sisted so she said after er while, 'Well, but I'm goin' ter stan' right\nhere an' when I say stop, yer got ter stop', an' they 'greed to dat, an'\nthe third time dey hit him she raised her han' an' said 'STOP' an' dey\nhad ter let my brother go. My Miss wuz a big 'oman, she'd weigh nigh on\nter three hundred pound, I 'spect.\"\n\n\nAfter her master's death Arrie had to go into the field to work. She\nrecalled with a little chuckle, the old cream horse, \"Toby\" she use to\nplow. She loved Toby, she said, and they did good work. When not plowing\nshe said she \"picked er round in the fields\" doing whatever she could.\nShe and the other slaves were not required to do very hard work. Her\nmother was a field hand, but in the evenings she spun and wove down in\ntheir cabin. Aunt Arrie added \"an' I did love to hear that old spinnin'\nwheel. It made a low kind of a whirring sound that made me sleepy.\" She\nsaid her mother, with all the other negro women on the place, had \"a\ntask of spinnin' a spool at night\", and they spun and wove on rainy days\ntoo. \"Ma made our clothes an' we had pretty dresses too. She dyed some\nblue and brown striped. We growed the indigo she used fer the blue,\nright dar on the plantation, and she used bark and leaves to make the\ntan and brown colors.\"\n\n\nAunt Arrie said the Doctor was always called in when they were sick,\n\"but we never sont fer him lesse'n somebody wuz real sick. De old folks\ndoctored us jest fer little ailments. Dey give us lye tea fer colds.\n(This was made by taking a few clean ashes from the fire place, putting\nthem in a little thin bag and pouring boiling water over them and let\nset for a few minutes. This had to be given very weak or else it would\nbe harmful, Aunt Arrie explained.) Garlic and whiskey, and den, dar\nain't nothin' better fer the pneumony dan splinter tea. I've cured bad\ncases with it.\" (That is made by pouring boiling water over lightwood\nsplinters.)\n\n\nAunt Arrie told of their life on the plantation and it was not unlike\nthat of other slaves who had good masters who looked after them. They\nhad plenty to eat and to wear. Their food was given them and they cooked\nand ate their meals in the cabins in family groups. Santa Claus always\nfound his way to the Quarters and brought them stick candy and other\nthings to eat. She said for their Christmas dinner there was always a\nbig fat hen and a hog head.\n\n\nIn slavery days the negroes had quiltings, dances, picnics and everybody\nhad a good time, Aunt Arrie said, \"an' I kin dance yit when I hears a\nfiddle.\" They had their work to do in the week days, but when Sundays\ncame there was no work, everybody rested and on \"preachin' days\" went to\nChurch. Her father took them all to old Rehoboth, the neighborhood white\nchurch, and they worshiped together, white and black, the negroes in\nthe gallery. That was back in the days when there was \"no lookin'\nneither to the right nor to the left\" when in church; no matter what\nhappened, no one could even half way smile. This all was much harder\nthan having to listen to the long tiresome sermons of those days, Arrie\nthinks, specially when she recalled on one occasion \"when Mr. Sutton wuz\na preachin' a old goat [HW: got] up under the Church an' every time Mr.\nSutton would say something out real loud that old goat would go 'Bah-a-a\nBah ba-a-a' an' we couldn't laugh a bit. I most busted, I wanted ter\nlaugh so bad.\"\n\n\n\"Yassum, in dem days\" continued Aunt Arrie, \"all us colored folks went\nto the white folks church kase us didn't have no churches of our own and\nday want no colored preachers den, but some what wuz called\n\"Chairbacks\". The Chairback fellows went er round preachin' an' singin'\nin the cabins down in the Quarters and dey use ter have the bes'\nmeetin's, folks would be converted an' change dey way. De hymns dey sung\nde most wuz \"Amazin' Grace\" an' \"Am I Born ter Die?\" I 'members de\nmeetin's us use ter have down in our cabin an' how everybody would pray\nan' sing.\"\n\n\n\"Dey ain't nothin' lak it use ter be,\" sighed Aunt Arrie, \"Now when I\nfirst could recollect, when a nigger died they sot up with de corpse all\nnight and de next day had de funeral an' when dey started to the burial\nground with the body every body in the whole procession would sing\nhymns. I've heard 'em 'nough times clear 'cross the fields, singin' and\nmoanin' as they went. Dem days of real feelin' an' keerin' is gone.\"\n\n\nWhen freedom came there were sad times on the Sybert plantation, Arrie\nsaid. \"Old Miss cried and cried, and all us cried too. Old Miss said\n'You'al jest goin' off to perish.' Aunt Jennie, one of the oldest women\nslaves stayed on with her and took keer of her, but all us stayed on a\nwhile. Us didn't know whar to go an' what ter do, an' den come Dr.\nPeters and Mr. Allen frum Arkansas to git han's to go out dar an' work\nfer dem. My Pa took his family and we stayed two years. It took us might\nnigh ar whole week to git dar, we went part way on de train and den rid\nde steam boat up de Mississippi River ter de landin'. We worked in the\ncotton field out dar and done all kinds er work on de farm, but us\ndidn't like an' Dr. Peters an' Mr. Allen give my Pa money fer us ter\ncome home on. 'Fore we could git started my oldest brother wanted to\ncome home so bad he jest pitched out and walked all de way frum Arkansas\nto our old home in Georgy. We come back by Memphis and den come on home\non de train. When we wuz out dar I went to school an' got as far as\n'Baker'. Dat's de only schoolin' I ever had.\"\n\n\nAunt Arrie told about her courtship and marriage, she remembers all\nabout it and grew rather sentimental and sad while she talked. She said\nthat Franklin Binns was going with her before she went to live in\nArkansas and when she came home he picked up the courtship where he had\nleft off when she went away. He would ride 20 miles on horseback to see\nher. He brought her candy and nice things to eat, but she still wouldn't\n\"give him no satisfaction 'bout whether she keered fer him er not.\" She\nsaid other men wanted to come to see her, but she paid them not one bit\nof attention. \"No mam, I wouldn't 'cept of them, I never did go with in\nan' everybody, I don't do dat yit.\" She said one day Franklin was to see\nher and said \"Less us marry, I think 'nough of you to marry.\" She said\nshe wouldn't tell him nothin' so he went to see her parents and they\nagreed, so she married him sometime later. They were married by a white\nminister, Mr. Joe Carter.\n\n\nAunt Arrie leads a lonely life now. She grieves for her loved ones more\nthan negroes usually do. She doesn't get about much, but \"I does go over\nto see Sis Lou (a neighbor) every now an' den fer consolation.\" She says\nshe is living on borrowed time because she has always taken care of\nherself and worked and been honest. She said that now she is almost at\nthe close of her life waiting day by day for the call to come, she is\nglad she knew slavery, glad she was reared by good white people who\ntaught her the right way to live, and she added: \"Mistess, I'se so glad\nI allus worked hard an' been honest--hit has sho paid me time an' time\nagin.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HW: Dist. 5\nExSlv. #7\nDriskell]\n\n\nHENRY BLAND--EX-SLAVE\n[MAY -- --]\n\n\n\n\nHenry Bland is one of the few living ex-slaves who was born on a\nplantation near Edenton, Ga., in 1851. His parents were Martha and Sam\nCoxton. In this family group were three other children, two girls and\none boy, who was the oldest. When questioned regarding the birthplace\nand the movements of his parents, Mr. Bland stated that his father was\nborn in Hancock County, Ga. His mother along with her mother was brought\nto Georgia by the speculator with a drove of other slaves. The first\nthing that he remembers of his parents is when he was quite small and\nwas allowed to remain in the Master's kitchen in the \"big house\" where\nhis mother was cook.\n\n\nMr. Coxton, who was the owner of Mr. Bland and his family, was described\nas being very rich and influential man in the community where he lived.\nSays Mr. Bland, \"His only fault was that of drinking too much of the\nwhisky that he distilled on the plantation.\" Unlike some of the other\nslave owners in that section, Mr. Coxton was very kind to his slaves.\nHis plantation was a large one and on it was raised cotton, corn,\ncane[TR:?], vegetables, and live stock. More cotton was grown than\nanything else.\n\n\nFrom the time he was 1 year and 6 months of age until he was 9 years old\nhe lived in the \"big house\" with his mother. At night he slept on the\nfloor there. In spite of this, his and his mother's treatment was\nconsiderably better than that received by those slaves who worked in the\nfields. While their food consisted of the same things as did that of the\nfield slaves, sometimes choice morsels came back to the kitchen from the\nMaster's table. He says that his mother's clothes were of better quality\nthan the other slave women (those who were not employed in the house).\n\n\nAs a child his first job was to cut wood for the stove, pick up chips,\nand to drive the cows to and from the pasture. When 9 years old he was\nsent to the field as a plow boy. Here he worked with a large number of\nother slaves (he does not know the exact number) who were divided into\ntwo groups, the plow group and the hoe group. His father happened to be\nthe foreman of the hoe gang. His brothers and sisters also worked here\nin the fields being required to hoe as well as plow. When picking time\ncame, everyone was required to pick. The usual amount of cotton each\nperson was required to pick was 200 lbs. per day. However, when this\namount was not picked by some they were not punished by the overseer, as\nwas the case on neighboring plantations, because Mr. Coxton realized\nthat some could do more work than others. Mr. Coxton often told his\noverseer that he had not been hired to whip the slaves, but to teach\nthem how to work.\n\n\nSays Mr. Bland: \"Our working hours were the same as on any other\nplantation. We had to get up every morning before sun-up and when it was\ngood and light we were in the field. A bugle was blown to wake us.\" All\nthe slaves stayed in the field until dark. After leaving the field they\nwere never required to do any work but could spend their time as they\nsaw fit to. No work was required on Saturday or Sunday with the\nexception that the stock had to be cared for. Besides those days when no\nwork was required, there was the 4th of July and Christmas on which the\nslaves were permitted to do as they pleased. These two latter dates were\nusually spent in true holiday spirit as the master usually gave a big\nfeast in the form of a barbecue and allowed them to invite their\nfriends.\n\n\nWhen darkness came they sang and danced and this was what they called a\n\"frolic.\" As a general rule this same thing was permitted after the\ncrops had been gathered. Music for these occasions was furnished by\nviolin, banjo and a clapping of hands. Mr. Bland says that he used to\nhelp furnish this music as Mr. Coxton had bought him a violin.\n\n\nOn the Coxton plantation all slaves always had a sufficient amount of\nclothing. These clothes which were issued when needed and not at any\ncertain time included articles for Sunday wear as well as articles for\nwork. Those servants who worked in the \"big house\" wore practically the\nsame clothes as the master and his wife with the possible exception that\nit met the qualification of being second-handed. An issue of work\nclothing included a heavy pair of work shoes called brogans, homespun\nshirts and a pair of jeans pants. A pair of knitted socks was also\nincluded The women wore homespun dresses for their working clothes. For\nSunday wear the men were given white cotton shirts and the women white\ncotton dresses. All clothing was made on the plantation by those women\nwho were too old for field work.\n\n\nIn the same manner that clothing was sufficient, so was food plentiful.\nAt the end of each week each family was given 4 lbs. of meat, 1 peck of\nmeal, and some syrup. Each person in a family was allowed to raise a\ngarden and so they had vegetables whenever they wished to. In addition\nto this they were allowed to raise chickens, to hunt and to fish.\nHowever, none of the food that was secured in any of the ways mentioned\nabove could be sold. When anyone wished to hunt, Mr. Coxton supplied the\ngun and the shot.\n\n\nAlthough the slaves cooked for themselves, their breakfast and dinner\nwere usually sent to them in the fields after it had been prepared in\nthe cook house. The reason for this was that they had to get up too soon\nin the morning, and at noon too much time would be lost if they were\npermitted to go to their cabins for lunch.\n\n\nThe children who were too young to work in the field were cared for by\nsome old slave who likewise was unable to do field work. The children\nwere usually fed pot liquor, corn bread, milk, syrup, and vegetables.\nEach one had his individual cup to eat from. The food on Sunday was\nusually no different from that of any other day of the week. However,\nMr. Bland says that they never had to break in the smokehouse because of\nhunger.\n\n\nWhen asked to describe the living quarters of the slaves on his\nplantation he looked around his room and muttered: \"Dey wuz a lot better\nthan dis one.\" Some of the cabins were made of logs and some of\nweatherboards. The chinks in the walls were sealed with mud. In some\ninstances boards were used on the inside to keep the weather out. There\nwere usually two windows, shutters being used in the place of window\npanes. The chimney and fireplace were made of mud and stones. All\ncooking was done at the fireplace as none of them were provided with\nstoves. Iron cooking utensils were used. To boil food a pot was hung\nover the fire by means of a hook. The remaining furniture was a bench\nwhich served as a chair, and a crude bed. Rope running from side to side\nserved as bed springs. The mattress was made of straw or hay. For\nlighting purposes, pine knots and candles were used. The slaves on the\nCoxton plantation were also fortunate in that all cabins had good\nfloors. All cabins and their furnishings were built by the slaves who\nlearned the use of hammer and saw from white artisans whom Mr. Coxton\nemployed from time to time. Mr. Bland remarked that his father was a\nblacksmith, having learned the trade in this manner.\n\n\nA doctor was employed regularly by Mr. Coxton to minister to the needs\nof the slaves in time of illness. \"We also had our own medicine,\" says\nMr. Bland. At different times excursions were made to the woods where\n\"yarbs\" (herbs) were gathered. Various kinds of teas and medicines were\nmade by boiling these roots in water. The usual causes of illness on\nthis plantation were colds, fevers, and constipation. Castor oil and\nsalts were also used to a great extent. If an individual was too ill to\nwork an older slave had to nurse this person.\n\n\nNo effort was made by Mr. Coxton to teach his slaves anything except\nmanual training. A slave who could use his hands at skilled work was\nmore valuable than the ordinary field hand. If, however, a slave secured\na book, Mr. Coxton would help him learn to read it. Above all, religious\ntraining was not denied. As a matter of fact, Mr. Coxton required each\none of his servants to dress in his Sunday clothes and to go to church\nevery Sunday. Services for all were held at the white church--the slaves\nsitting on one side and the masters on the other. All preaching was done\nby a white pastor.\n\n\nNo promiscuous relationships were allowed. If a man wanted to marry he\nmerely pointed out the woman of his choice to the master. He in turn\ncalled her and told her that such and such an individual wished her for\na wife. If she agreed they were pronounced man and wife and were\npermitted to live together.\n\n\nThe slaves on his plantation were great believers in roots and their\nvalues in the use of conjuring people.\n\n\nMr. Bland doesn't remember ever seeing anyone sold by Mr. Coxton, but he\nheard that on other nearby plantations slaves were placed on an auction\nblock and sold like cattle.\n\n\nNone of the slaves were ever whipped or beaten by Mr. Coxton or by\nanyone else. If a rule was broken the offender was called before Mr.\nCoxton where he was talked to. In some cases a whipping was promised and\nthat ended the matter. The \"Paddie Rollers\" whipped the slaves from\nother plantations when they were caught off of their premises without a\n\"pass\" but this was never the case when a slave belonging to Mr. Coxton\nbroke this rule. Mr. Bland remembers that once he and some of his fellow\nslaves were away from home without a pass when they were seen by the\n\"Paddie Rollers\" who started after them. When they were recognized as\nbelonging to Mr. Coxton one of them (Paddie Rollers) said: \"Don't bother\nthem; that's them d---- 'free niggers'.\" The Paddie Rollers were not\nallowed to come on the Coxton plantation to whip his slaves or any other\nowner's slaves who happened to be visiting at the time. Mr. Coxton\nrequired that they all be on the plantation by nightfall.\n\n\n(The above seems to be rather conclusive proof of Mr. Coxton's influence\nin the community.) [TR: Parentheses added by hand.]\n\n\nWhenever a slave committed a crime against the State, his master usually\nhad to pay for the damage done or pay the slave's fine. It was then up\nto him to see that the offender was punished.\n\n\nMr. Coxton once saw him (Mr. Bland) beat another slave (who was a guest\nat a frolic) when this visitor attempted to draw a pistol on him. Mr.\nBland was upheld in his action and told by Mr. Coxton that he had better\nalways fight back when anyone struck him, whether the person was white\nor black. Further, if he (Mr. Coxton) heard of his not fighting back a\nwhipping would be in store for him.\n\n\nMr. Coxton was different from some of the slave owners in that he gave\nthe head of each family spending money at Christmas time--the amount\nvarying with the size of the family.\n\n\n\"When the Civil war was begun the master seemed to be worried all the\ntime\" states Mr. Bland. \"He was afraid that we would be freed and then\nhe would have to hire us to do his work.\"\n\n\nWhen asked to describe his feelings about the war and the possibility of\nhis being freed, Mr. Bland said that he had no particular feeling of\ngladness at all. The outcome of the war did not interest him at all\nbecause Mr. Coxton was such a good master he didn't care whether he was\nfreed or not. His fellow slaves felt the same way.\n\n\nWhen Sherman and the Yankees were marching through they took all of the\nlive stock but bothered nothing else. The buildings on the adjoining\nplantation were all burned. A small skirmish took place about 2 miles\naway from Mr. Coxton's plantation when the Yankees and Confederates met.\nMr. Coxton's two sons took part in the war.\n\n\nMr. Bland was taken by Sherman's army to Savannah and then to Macon. He\nsays that he saw President Jeff Davis give up his sword to General\nSherman in surrender.\n\n\nAfter the war Mr. Coxton was still well off in spite of the fact that he\nhad lost quite a bit of money as a result of the war. He saved a great\ndeal of his cash by burying it when Sherman came through. The cattle\nmight have been saved if he (Mr. Bland) could have driven them into the\nwoods before he was seen by some of the soldiers.\n\n\nAt the close of the war Mr. Coxton informed all the slaves that they\nwere free to go where they wished, but they all refused to leave. Most\nof them died on the plantation. Mr. Bland says that when he became of\nage his former master gave him a wagon, two mules, a horse and buggy and\nten pigs.\n\n\nMr. Bland thinks that old age is a characteristic in his family. His\ngrandmother lived to be 115 years old and his mother 107 years old.\nAlthough in his 80's, Mr. Bland is an almost perfect picture of health.\nHe thinks that he will live to become at least 100 years old because he\nis going to continue to live as sane a life as he has in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.R. Jones\n\n\nRIAS BODY, Ex-Slave.\nPlace of birth: Harris County, near Waverly Hall, Georgia\nDate of birth: April 9, 1846\nPresent residence: 1419-24th Street, Columbus, Georgia\nInterviewed: July 24, 1936\n[JUL 8, 1937]\n\n\n\n\nRias Body was born the slave property of Mr. Ben Body, a Harris County\nplanter. He states that he was about fifteen years old when the Civil\nWar started and, many years ago, his old time white folks told him that\nApril 9, 1846, was the date of his birth.\n\n\nThe \"patarolers,\" according to \"Uncle\" Rias, were always quite active in\nante-bellum days. The regular patrol consisted of six men who rode\nnightly, different planters and overseers taking turns about to do\npatrol duty in each militia district in the County.\n\n\nAll slaves were required to procure passes from their owners or their\nplantation overseers before they could go visiting or leave their home\npremises. If the \"patarolers\" caught a \"Nigger\" without a pass, they\nwhipped him and sent him home. Sometimes, however, if the \"Nigger\"\ndidn't run and told a straight story, he was let off with a lecture and\na warning. Slave children, though early taught to make themselves\nuseful, had lots of time for playing and frolicking with the white\nchildren.\n\n\nRias was a great hand to go seining with a certain clique of white boys,\nwho always gave him a generous or better than equal share of the fish\ncaught.\n\n\nAt Christmas, every slave on the Body plantation received a present. The\nNegro children received candy, raisins and \"nigger-toes\", balls,\nmarbles, etc.\n\n\nAs for food, the slaves had, with the exception of \"fancy trimmins\",\nabout the same food that the whites ate. No darky in Harris County that\nhe ever heard of ever went hungry or suffered for clothes until after\nfreedom.\n\n\nEvery Saturday was a wash day. The clothes and bed linen of all Whites\nand Blacks went into wash every Saturday. And \"Niggers\", whether they\nliked it or not, had to \"scrub\" themselves every Saturday night.\n\n\nThe usual laundry and toilet soap was a homemade lye product, some of it\na soft-solid, and some as liquid as water. The latter was stored in jugs\nand demijohns. Either would \"fetch the dirt, or take the hide off\"; in\nshort, when applied \"with rag and water, something had to come\".\n\n\nMany of the Body slaves had wives and husbands living on other\nplantations and belonging to other planters. As a courtesy to the\nprincipals of such matrimonial alliances, their owners furnished the men\npasses permitting them to visit their wives once or twice a week.\nChildren born to such unions were the property of the wife's owner; the\nfather's owner had no claim to them whatsoever.\n\n\n\"Uncle\" Rias used to frequently come to Columbus with his master before\nthe war, where he often saw \"Niggers oxioned off\" at the old slave mart\nwhich was located at what is now 1225 Broadway. Negroes to be offered\nfor sale were driven to Columbus in droves--like cattle--by \"Nawthon\nspeckulatahs\". And prospective buyers would visit the \"block\"\naccompanied by doctors, who would feel of, thump, and examine the\n\"Nigger\" to see if sound. A young or middle-aged Negro man, specially or\neven well trained in some trade or out-of-the-ordinary line of work,\noften sold for from $2000.00 to $4000.00 in gold. Women and \"runty\nNigger men\" commanded a price of from $600.00 up, each. A good \"breedin\noman\", though, says \"Uncle\" Rias, would sometimes sell for as high as\n$1200.00.\n\n\nRias Body had twelve brothers, eight of whom were \"big buck Niggers,\"\nand older than himself. The planters and \"patarolers\" accorded these\n\"big Niggers\" unusual privileges--to the end that he estimates that they\n\"wuz de daddies uv least a hunnert head o' chillun in Harris County\nbefore de war broke out.\" Some of these children were \"scattered\" over a\nwide area.\n\n\nSin, according to Rias Body, who voices the sentiment of the great\nmajority of aged Negroes, is that, or everything, which one does and\nsays \"not in the name of the Master\". The holy command, \"Whatever ye do,\ndo it in My name,\" is subjected to some very unorthodox interpretations\nby many members of the colored race. Indeed, by their peculiar\ninterpretation of this command, it is established that \"two clean sheets\ncan't smut\", which means that a devout man and woman may indulge in the\nprimal passion without committing sin.\n\n\nThe old man rather boasts of the fact that he received a number of\nwhippings when a slave: says he now knows that he deserved them, \"an\nthout 'em\", he would have no doubt \"been hung 'fore he wuz thutty years\nole.\"\n\n\nAmong the very old slaves whom he knew as a boy were quite a few whom\nthe Negroes looked up to, respected, and feared as witches, wizzards,\nand magic-workers. These either brought their \"learnin\" with them from\nAfrica or absorbed it from their immediate African forebears. Mentally,\nthese people wern't brilliant, but highly sensitized, and Rias gave \"all\nsich\" as wide a berth as opportunity permitted him, though he knows \"dat\ndey had secret doins an carrying-ons\". In truth, had the Southern Whites\nnot curbed the mumbo-jumboism of his people, he is of the opinion that\nit would not now be safe to step \"out his doe at night\".\n\n\nIncidentally, Rias Body is more fond of rabbit than any other meat \"in\nde wurrul\", and says that he could--if he were able to get them--eat\nthree rabbits a day, 365 days in the year, and two for breakfast on\nChristmas morning. He also states that pork, though killed in the\nhottest of July weather, will not spoil if it is packed down in shucked\ncorn-on-the-cob. This he learned in slavery days when, as a \"run-away\",\nhe \"knocked a shoat in the head\" one summer and tried it--proving it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEX-SLAVE INTERVIEW\n\n\nJAMES BOLTON\nAthens, Georgia\n\n\nWritten by:\nMrs. Sarah H. Hall\nFederal Writers' Project\nResidency 4\nAthens, Georgia\n\n\nEdited by:\nMiss Maude Barragan\nResidency 13\nAugusta, Georgia\n\n\n\n\n\"It never was the same on our plantation atter we done laid Mistess\naway,\" said James Bolton, 85 year old mulatto ex-slave. \"I ain't never\nforget when Mistess died--she had been so good to every nigger on our\nplantation. When we got sick, Mistess allus had us tended to. The\nniggers on our plantation all walked to church to hear her funeral\nsermon and then walked to the graveyard to the buryin'.\"\n\n\nJames, shrivelled and wrinkled, with his bright eyes taking in\neverything on one of his rare visits to town, seemed glad of the chance\nto talk about slavery days. He spoke of his owner as \"my employer\" and\nhastily corrected himself by saying, \"I means, my marster.\"\n\n\n\"My employer, I means my marster, and my mistess, they was sho' all\nright white folkses,\" he continued. \"They lived in the big 'ouse. Hit\nwas all painted brown. I heard tell they was more'n 900 acres in our\nplantation and lots of folkses lived on it. The biggest portion was\nwoods. My paw, he was name Whitfield Bolton and Liza Bolton was my maw.\nCharlie, Edmund, Thomas and John Bolton was my brothers and I had one\nsister, she was Rosa. We belonged to Marse Whitfield Bolton and we lived\non his plantation in Oglethorpe County near Lexington, not far from the\nWilkes County line.\n\n\n\"We stayed in a one room log cabin with a dirt floor. A frame made\nouten pine poles was fastened to the wall to hold up the mattresses. Our\nmattresses was made outen cotton bagging stuffed with wheat straw. Our\nkivers was quilts made outen old clothes. Slave 'omens too old to work\nin the fields made the quilts.\n\n\n\"Maw, she went up to the big house onc't a week to git the 'lowance or\nvittles. They 'lowanced us a week's rations at a time. Hit were\ngenerally hog meat, corn meal and sometimes a little flour. Maw, she\ndone our cookin' on the coals in the fireplace at our cabin. We had\nplenty of 'possums and rabbits and fishes and sometimes we had wild\ntukkeys and partidges. Slaves warn't spozen to go huntin' at night and\neverybody know you can't ketch no 'possums 'ceppin' at night! Jus' the\nsame, we had plenty 'possums and nobody ax how we cotch 'em!\" James\nlaughed and nodded. \"Now, 'bout them rabbits! Slaves warn't 'lowed to\nhave no guns and no dogs of they own. All the dogs on our plantation\nbelonged to my employer--I means, to my marster, and he 'lowed us to use\nhis dogs to run down the rabbits. Nigger mens and boys 'ud go in crowds,\nsometimes as many as twelve at one time, and a rabbit ain't got no\nchance 'ginst a lot of niggers and dogs when they light out for to run\n'im down!\n\n\n\"What wild critters we wanted to eat and couldn't run down, we was right\nsmart 'bout ketchin' in traps. We cotch lots of wild tukkeys and\npartidges in traps and nets. Long Crick runned through our plantation\nand the river warn't no fur piece off. We sho' did ketch the fishes,\nmostly cats, and perch and heaps and heaps of suckers. We cotch our\nfishes mos'n generally with hook and line, but the carpenters on our\nplantation knowed how to make basket traps that sho' nuff did lay in\nthe fishes! God only knows how long it's been since this old nigger\npulled a big shad out of the river. Ain't no shads been cotch in the\nriver round here in so long I disremembers when!\n\n\n\"We didn' have no gardens of our own round our cabins. My employer--I\nmeans, my marster--had one big gyarden for our whole plantation and all\nhis niggers had to work in it whensomever he wanted 'em to, then he give\n'em all plenty good gyarden sass for theyselfs. They was collards and\ncabbage and turnips and beets and english peas and beans and onions, and\nthey was allus some garlic for ailments. Garlic was mostly to cure wums\n(worms). They roasted the garlic in the hot ashes and squez the juice\nouten it and made the chilluns take it. Sometimes they made poultices\nouten garlic for the pneumony.\n\n\n\"We saved a heap of bark from wild cherry and poplar and black haw and\nslippery ellum trees and we dried out mullein leaves. They was all mixed\nand brewed to make bitters. Whensomever a nigger got sick, them bitters\nwas good for--well ma'am, they was good for what ailed 'em! We tuk 'em\nfor rheumatiz, for fever, and for the misery in the stummick and for\nmost all sorts of sickness. Red oak bark tea was good for sore throat.\n\n\n\"I never seed no store bought clothes twel long atter freedom done come!\nOne slave 'oman done all the weavin' in a separate room called the 'loom\nhouse.' The cloth was dyed with home-made coloring. They used indigo for\nblue, red oak bark for brown, green husks offen warnicks (walnuts) for\nblack, and sumacs for red and they'd mix these colors to make other\ncolors. Other slave 'omans larned to sew and they made all the clothes.\nEndurin' the summertime we jus' wore shirts and pants made outen plain\ncotton cloth. They wove wool in with the cotton to make the cloth for\nour winter clothes. The wool was raised right thar on our plantation. We\nhad our own shoemaker man--he was a slave named Buck Bolton and he made\nall the shoes the niggers on our plantation wore.\n\n\n\"I waren't nothin' but chillun when freedom come. In slavery-time\nchilluns waren't 'lowed to do no wuk kazen the marsters wanted they\nniggers to grow up big and strong and didn' want 'em stunted none. Tha's\nhowcome I didn' git no mo' beatin's than I did! My employer--I means, my\nmarster, never did give me but one lickin'. He had done told me to watch\nthe cows and keep 'em in the pastur'. I cotch lots of grasshoppers and\nstarted fishin' in the crick runnin' through the pastur' and fust thing\nI knowed, the overseer was roundin' up all the other niggers to git the\ncows outen the cornfields! I knowed then my time had done come!\"\n\n\nJames was enjoying the spotlight now, and his audience did not have to\nprompt him. Plantation recollections crowded together in his old mind.\n\n\n\"We had one overseer at a time,\" he said, \"and he allus lived at the big\n'ouse. The overseers warn't quality white folkses like our marster and\nmistess but we never heard nuffin' 'bout no poor white trash in them\ndays, and effen we had heard sumpin' like that we'd have knowed better'n\nto let Marster hear us make such talk! Marster made us call his overseer\n'Mister.' We had one overseer named Mr. Andrew Smith and another time\nwe had a overseer named Mr. Pope Short. Overseers was jus' there on the\nbusiness of gettin' the work done--they seed atter everybody doin' his\nwuk 'cordin' to order.\n\n\n\"My employer--I means, my marster, never 'lowed no overseer to whup none\nof his niggers! Marster done all the whuppin' on our plantation hisself.\nHe never did make no big bruises and he never drawed no blood, but he\nsho' could burn 'em up with that lash! Niggers on our plantation was\nwhupped for laziness mostly. Next to that, whuppings was for stealin'\neggs and chickens. They fed us good and plenty but a nigger is jus'\nbound to pick up chickens and eggs effen he kin, no matter how much he\ndone eat! He jus' can't help it. Effen a nigger ain't busy he gwine to\ngit into mischief!\n\n\n\"Now and then slaves 'ud run away and go in the woods and dig dens and\nlive in 'em. Sometimes they runned away on 'count of cruel treatment,\nbut most of the time they runned away kazen they jus' didn't want to\nwuk, and wanted to laze around for a spell. The marsters allus put the\ndogs atter 'em and git 'em back. They had black and brown dogs called\n'nigger hounds' what waren't used for nothin' but to track down niggers.\n\n\n\"They waren't no such place as a jail whar we was. Effen a nigger done\nsumpin' disorderly they jus' natcherly tuk a lash to 'im. I ain't never\nseed no nigger in chains twel long atter freedom done come when I seed\n'em on the chain gangs.\n\n\n\"The overseer woke us up at sunrise--leas'n they called it sunrise! We\nwould finish our vittles and be in the fields ready for wuk befo' we\nseed any sun! We laid off wuk at sunset and they didn't drive us hard.\nLeas'wise, they didn' on our plantation. I done heard they was moughty\nhard on 'em on other plantations. My marster never did 'low his niggers\nto wuk atter sundown. My employer, I means my marster, didn't have no\nbell. He had 'em blow bugles to wake up his hands and to call 'em from\nthe fields. Sometimes the overseer blowed it. Mistess done larned the\ncook to count the clock, but none of the rest of our niggers could count\nthe clock.\n\n\n\"I never knowed Marster to sell but one slave and he jus' had bought her\nfrom the market at New Orleans. She say it lonesome off on the\nplantation and axed Marster for to sell her to folkses livin' in town.\nAtter he done sold her, every time he got to town she beg 'im to buy her\nback! But he didn' pay her no more 'tention. When they had sales of\nslaves on the plantations they let everybody know what time the sale\ngwine to be. When the crowd git togedder they put the niggers on the\nblock and sell 'em. Leas'wise, they call it 'puttin' on the block'--they\njus' fotch 'em out and show 'em and sell 'em.\n\n\n\"They waren't no church for niggers on our plantation and we went to\nwhite folkses church and listened to the white preachers. We set behind\na partition. Sometimes on a plantation a nigger claim he done been\ncalled to preach and effen he kin git his marster's cawn-sent he kin\npreach round under trees and in cabins when t'aint wuk time. These\nnigger preachers in slavery time was called 'chairbackers.' They waren't\nno chairbackers 'lowed to baptize none of Marster's niggers. White\npreachers done our baptizin' in Long Crick. When we went to be baptized\nthey allus sang, 'Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound!'\"\n\n\nThe old negro's quavery voice rose in the familiar song. For a moment he\nsat thinking of those long-ago Sundays. His eyes brightened again, and\nhe went on:\n\n\n\"We never done no wuk on Sundays on our plantation. The church was 'bout\nnine miles from the plantation and we all walked there. Anybody too old\nand feeble to walk the nine miles jus' stayed home, kazen Marster didn't\n'low his mules used none on Sunday. All along the way niggers from other\nplantations 'ud jine us and sometimes befo' we git to the church house\nthey'd be forty or fifty slaves comin' along the road in a crowd!\nPreaching generally lasted twel bout three o'clock. In summertime we had\ndinner on the ground at the church. Howsomever we didn' have no barbecue\nlike they does now. Everybody cooked enough on Sadday and fotched it in\nbaskets.\n\n\n\"I was thirty years old when I jined the church. Nobody ought to jine no\nchurch twels't he is truly borned of God, and effen he is truly borned\nof God he gwine know it. Effen you want a restin' place atter you leaves\nthis old world you ought to git ready for it now!\n\n\n\"When folkses on our plantation died Marster allus let many of us as\nwanted to go, lay offen wuk twel atter the buryin'. Sometimes it were\ntwo or three months atter the buryin' befo' the funeral sermon was\npreached. Right now I can't rekelleck no song we sung at funerals cep'n\n'Hark from the tombs a doleful sound.'\"\n\n\nThe reedy old voice carried the funeral hymn for a few minutes and then\ntrailed off. James was thinking back into the past again.\n\n\n\"Spring plowin' and hoein' times we wukked all day Saddays, but mos'en\ngenerally we laid off wuk at twelve o'clock Sadday. That was dinnertime.\nSadday nights we played and danced. Sometimes in the cabins, sometimes\nin the yards. Effen we didn' have a big stack of fat kindling wood lit\nup to dance by, sometimes the mens and 'omans would carry torches of\nkindling wood whils't they danced and it sho' was a sight to see! We\ndanced the 'Turkey Trot' and 'Buzzard Lope', and how we did love to\ndance the 'Mary Jane!' We would git in a ring and when the music started\nwe would begin wukkin' our footses while we sang 'You steal my true love\nand I steal your'n!'\n\n\n\"Atter supper we used to gether round and knock tin buckets and pans, we\nbeat 'em like drums. Some used they fingers and some used sticks for to\nmake the drum sounds and somebody allus blowed on quills. Quills was a\nrow of whistles made outen reeds, or sometimes they made 'em outen bark.\nEvery whistle in the row was a different tone and you could play any\nkind of tune you wants effen you had a good row of quills. They sho' did\nsound sweet!\n\n\n\"'Bout the most fun we had was at corn shuckin's whar they put the corn\nin long piles and called in the folkses from the plantations nigh round\nto shuck it. Sometimes four or five hunnert head of niggers 'ud be\nshuckin' corn at one time. When the corn all done been shucked they'd\ndrink the likker the marsters give 'em and then frolic and dance from\nsundown to sunup. We started shuckin' corn 'bout dinnertime and tried to\nfinish by sundown so we could have the whole night for frolic. Some\nyears we 'ud go to ten or twelve corn shuckin's in one year!\n\n\n\"We would sing and pray Easter Sunday and on Easter Monday we frolicked\nand danced all day long! Christmas we allus had plenty good sumpin' to\neat and we all got togedder and had lots of fun. We runned up to the big\n'ouse early Christmas mornin' and holler out: 'Mornin', Christmas Gif'!'\nThen they'd give us plenty of Sandy Claus and we would go back to our\ncabins to have fun twel New Year's day. We knowed Christmas was over and\ngone when New Year's day come, kazen we got back to wuk that day atter\nfrolickin' all Christmas week.\n\n\n\"We didn' know nuttin' 'bout games to play. We played with the white\nfolkses chilluns and watched atter 'em but most of the time we played in\nthe crick what runned through the pastur'. Nigger chilluns was allus\nskeered to go in the woods atter dark. Folkses done told us\nRaw-Head-and-Bloody Bones lived in the woods and git little chilluns and\neat 'em up effen they got out in the woods atter dark!\n\n\n\"'Rockabye baby in the tree trops' was the onliest song I heard my maw\nsing to git her babies to sleep. Slave folkses sung most all the time\nbut we didn' think of what we sang much. We jus' got happy and started\nsingin'. Sometimes we 'ud sing effen we felt sad and lowdown, but soon\nas we could, we 'ud go off whar we could go to sleep and forgit all\n'bout trouble!\" James nodded his gray head with a wise look in his\nbright eyes. \"When you hear a nigger singin' sad songs hit's jus' kazen\nhe can't stop what he is doin' long enough to go to sleep!\"\n\n\nThe laughter that greeted this sally brought an answering grin to the\nwrinkled old face. Asked about marriage customs, James said:\n\n\n\"Folkses didn' make no big to-do over weddings like they do now. When\nslaves got married they jus' laid down the broom on the floor and the\ncouple jined hands and jumped back-uds over the broomstick. I done seed\n'em married that way many a time. Sometimes my marster would fetch\nMistess down to the slave quarters to see a weddin'. Effen the slaves\ngittin' married was house servants, sometimes they married on the back\nporch or in the back yard at the big 'ouse but plantation niggers what\nwas field hands married in they own cabins. The bride and groom jus'\nwore plain clothes kazen they didn' have no more.\n\n\n\"When the young marsters and mistesses at the big houses got married\nthey 'lowed the slaves to gadder on the porch and peep through the\nwindows at the weddin'. Mos'en generally they 'ud give the young couple\na slave or two to take with them to they new home. My marster's chilluns\nwas too young to git married befo' the war was over. They was seven of\nthem chilluns; four of 'em was gals.\n\n\n\"What sort of tales did they tell 'mongs't the slaves 'bout the Norf\nbefo' the war? To tell the troof, they didn't talk much like they does\nnow 'bout them sort of things. None of our niggers ever runned away and\nwe didn' know nuthin' 'bout no Norf twel long atter freedom come. We\nvisited round each other's cabins at night. I did hear tell 'bout the\npatterollers. Folkses said effen they cotched niggers out at night they\n'ud give 'em 'what Paddy give the drum'.\n\n\n\"Jus' befo' freedom comed 'bout 50 Yankee sojers come through our\nplantation and told us that the bull-whups and cow-hides was all dead\nand buried. Them sojers jus' passed on in a hurry and didn' stop for a\nmeal or vittles or nuffin'. We didn't talk much 'bout Mr. Abbieham\nLincum endurin' slavery time kazen we was skeered of him atter the war\ngot started. I don't know nothin' 'bout Mr. Jef'son Davis, I don't\nremember ever hearin' 'bout him. I is heard about Mr. Booker Washin'ton\nand they do say he runned a moughty good school for niggers.\n\n\n\"One mornin' Marster blowed the bugle his own self and called us all up\nto the big 'ouse yard. He told us: 'You all jus' as free as I is. You\nare free from under the taskmarster but you ain't free from labor. You\ngotter labor and wuk hard effen you aims to live and eet and have\nclothes to wear. You kin stay here and wuk for me, or you kin go\nwharsomever you please.' He said he 'ud pay us what was right, and Lady,\nhit's the troof, they didn't nary a nigger on our plantation leave our\nmarster then! I wukked on with Marster for 40 years atter the war!\"\n\n\nJames had no fear of the Ku Klux.\n\n\n\"Right soon atter the war we saw plenty of Ku Kluxers but they never\nbothered nobody on our plantation. They allus seemed to be havin' heaps\nof fun. 'Course, they did have to straighten out some of them brash\nyoung nigger bucks on some of the other farms round about. Mos' of the\nniggers the Ku Kluxers got atter was'n on no farm, but was jus' roamin'\n'round talkin' too much and makin' trouble. They had to take 'em in hand\ntwo or three times befo' some of them fool free niggers could be larned\nto behave theyselfs! But them Ku Kluxers kept on atter 'em twels't they\nlarned they jus got to be good effen they 'spects to stay round here.\n\n\n\"Hit was about 40 years atter the war befo' many niggers 'gun to own\nthey own lan'. They didn' know nothin' 'bout tendin' to money business\nwhen the war done ended and it take 'em a long time to larn how to buy\nand sell and take care of what they makes.\" James shook his head sadly.\n\"Ma'am, heaps of niggers ain't never larned nothin' 'bout them things\nyit!\n\n\n\"A long time atter the war I married Lizy Yerby. I didn' give Liza no\nchanc't for to dress up. Jus' went and tuk her right outer the white\nfolkses' kitchen and married her at the church in her workin' clothes.\nWe had 13 chilluns but they ain't but two of 'em livin' now. Mos' of our\nchilluns died babies. Endurin' slavery Mistess tuk care of all the\nnigger babies borned on our plantations and looked atter they mammies\ntoo, but atter freedom come heap of nigger babies died out.\"\n\n\nJames said he had two wives, both widows.\n\n\n\"I married my second wife 37 years ago. To tell the troof, I don't\nrightly know how many grandchilluns I got, kazen I ain't seed some of\n'em for thirty years. My chilluns is off fum here and I wouldn' know to\nsave my life whar they is or what they does. My sister and brothers they\nis done dead out what ain't gone off, I don't know for sho' whar none of\n'em is now.\"\n\n\nA sigh punctuated James' monologue, and his old face was shadowed by a\nlook of fear.\n\n\n\"Now I gwine tell you the troof. Now that it's all over I don't find\nlife so good in my old age, as it was in slavery time when I was chillun\ndown on Marster's plantation. Then I didn' have to worry 'bout whar my\nclothes and my somepin' to eat was comin' from or whar I was gwine to\nsleep. Marster tuk keer of all that. Now I ain't able for to wuk and\nmake a livin' and hit's sho' moughty hard on this old nigger.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALEC BOSTWICK\nEx-Slave--Age 76\n\n\n[TR: Preceding page that would usually contain information regarding the\ninterview was marked 'Placeholder'.]\n\n\n\n\nAll of Uncle Alec Bostwick's people are dead and he lives in his tiny\nhome with a young Negress named Emma Vergal. It was a beautiful April\nmorning when his visitor arrived and while he was cordial enough he\nseemed very reluctant about talking. However, as one question followed\nanother his interest gradually overcame his hesitancy and he began to\nunfold his life's story.\n\n\n\"I wuz born in Morgan County, an' I warn't mo' dan four year old when de\nWar ended so I don't ricollect nothin' 'bout slav'ry days. I don't know\nmuch 'bout my ma, but her name was Martha an' pa's name was Jordan\nBostwick, I don't know whar dey come from. When I knowed nothin' I wuz\ndar on de plantation. I had three brothers; George, John an' Reeje, an'\ndey's all dead. I dis'members my sister's name. Dar warn't but one gal\nan' she died when she wuz little.\n\n\n\"Ain't much to tell 'bout what wuz done in de quarters. Slaves wuz\ngyarded all de time jus' lak Niggers on de chain gang now. De overseer\nalways sot by wid a gun.\n\n\n\"'Bout de beds, Nigger boys didn't pay no 'tention to sich as dat 'cause\nall dey keered 'bout wuz a place to sleep but 'peers lak to me dey wuz\ncorded beds, made wid four high posties, put together wid iron pegs, an'\nholes what you run de cords thoo', bored in de sides. De cords wuz made\nout of b'ar grass woun' tight together. Dey put straw an' old quilts on\n'em, an' called 'em beds.\n\n\n\"Gran'pa Berry wuz too old to wuk in de field so he stayed 'roun' de\nhouse an' piddled. He cut up wood, tended to de gyarden an' yard, an'\nbottomed chairs. Gran'ma Liza done de cookin' an' nussed de white\nfolkses chilluns.\n\n\n\"I wukked in de field 'long side da rest of de Niggers, totin' water an'\nsich lak, wid de overseer dar all de time wid dat gun.\n\n\n\"What you talkin' 'bout Miss? Us didn't have no money. Sho' us didn't.\nDey had to feed us an' plenty of it, 'cause us couldn't wuk if dey\ndidn't feed us good.\n\n\n\"Us et cornbread, sweet 'tatoes, peas, home-made syrup an' sich lak. De\nmeat wuz fried sometimes, but mos' of de time it wuz biled wid de\ngreens. All de somethin' t'eat wuz cooked in de fireplace. Dey didn't\nknow what stoves wuz in dem days. Yes Ma'am, us went 'possum huntin' at\nnight, an' us had plenty 'possums too. Dey put sweet 'tatoes an' fat\nmeat roun' 'em, an' baked 'em in a oven what had eyes on each side of it\nto put hooks in to take it off de fire wid.\n\n\n\"No Ma'am, us didn't go fishin', or rabbit huntin' nuther. Us had to wuk\nan' warn't no Nigger 'lowed to do no frolickin' lak dat in daytime. De\nwhite folkses done all de fishin' an' daytime huntin'. I don't 'member\nlakin' no sartin' somethin'. I wuz jus' too glad to git anythin'. Slaves\ndidn't have no gyardens of dey own. Old Marster had one big gyarden what\nall de slaves et out of.\n\n\n\"Tell you 'bout our clo'es: us wore home-made clo'es, pants an' shirts\nmade out of cotton in summer an' in de winter dey give us mo' home-made\nclo'es only dey wuz made of wool. All de clawf wuz made on de loom right\ndar on de plantation. Us wore de same things on Sunday what us did in de\nweek, no diffunt. Our shoes wuz jus' common brogans what dey made at\nhome. I ain't seed no socks 'til long atter de War. Co'se some folkses\nmought a had 'em, but us didn't have none.\n\n\n\"Marster Berry Bostwick an' Mist'ess Mary Bostwick, had a passel of\nchillun, I don't 'member none 'cept young Marse John. De others drifted\noff an' didn't come back, but young Marse John stayed on wid Old Marster\nan' Old Mist'ess 'til dey died. Old Marster, he warn't good. Truth is de\nlight, an' he wuz one mean white man. Old Mist'ess wuz heaps better dan\nhim. Dar wuz 'bout 150 mens an' 75 'omans. I couldn't keep up wid de\nchilluns. Dere wuz too many for me.\n\n\n\"Marster an' Mist'ess lived in a big fine house, but de slave quarters\nwuz made of logs, 'bout de size of box cyars wid two rooms.\n\n\n\"'Bout dat overseer he wuz a mean man, if one ever lived. He got de\nslaves up wid a gun at five o'clock an' wukked 'em 'til way atter\nsundown, standin' right over 'em wid a gun all de time. If a Nigger\nlagged or tuk his eyes off his wuk, right den an' dar he would make him\nstrip down his clo'es to his waist, an' he whup him wid a cat-o-nine\ntails. Evvy lick dey struck him meant he wuz hit nine times, an' it\nfotch da red evvy time it struck.\n\n\n\"Oh! Yes Ma'am, dey had a cyar'iage driver, he didn't do much 'cept look\nattar de hawses an' drive de white folkses 'roun'.\n\n\n\"I done tole you 'bout dat overseer; all he done wuz sot 'roun' all day\nwid a gun an' make de Niggers wuk. But I'se gwine tell you de trufe, he\nsho' wuz poor white trash wid a house full of snotty-nose chilluns. Old\nMarster tole him he wuz jus' lak a rabbit, he had so many chillun. I\nmeans dis; if dem days comes back I hope de good Lord takes me fus'.\n\n\n\"Dey had a house whar dey put de Niggers, what wuz called de gyard\nhouse, an' us didn't know nothin' 'bout no jail dat day an' time. I seed\n'em drive de Niggers by old Marster's place in droves takin' 'em to\nWatkinsville. Morgan County, whar us lived, touched Oconee an' dat wuz\nthe nighes' town. One day I went wid old Marster to Watkinsville an' I\nseed 'em sell Niggers on de block. I warn't sold. When I knowed nothin'\nI wuz right whar I wuz at.\n\n\n\"No Ma'am, dey warn't no schools for de Niggers in dem days. If a Nigger\nwuz seed wid a paper, de white folks would pretty nigh knock his head\noff him.\n\n\n\"Us didn't have no church in de country for Niggers, an' dey went to\nchurch wid deir white folkses, if dey went a tall. De white folks sot in\nfront, an' de Niggers sot in de back. All de time dat overseer wuz right\ndar wid his gun. When dey baptized de Niggers dey tuk 'em down to de\nriver and plunged 'em in, while dem what had done been baptized sang:\n\"Dar's a Love Feast in Heb'en Today.\"\n\n\n\"Yes Ma'am, de white folkses had deir cemetery, an' dey had one for de\nslaves. When dere wuz a funeral 'mong de Niggers us sung:\n\n\n  'Dark was de night\n   And cold was de groun'\n   Whar my Marster was laid\n   De drops of sweat\n   Lak blood run down\n   In agony He prayed.'\n\n\n\"Dem coffins sho' wuz mournful lookin' things, made out of pine boa'ds\nan' painted wid lampblack; dey wuz black as de night. Dey wuz big at de\nhead an' little at de foot, sort a lak airplanes is. De inside wuz lined\nwid white clawf, what dey spun on de plantation.\n\n\n\"De patterollers wuz right on dey job. Slaves use' to frame up on 'em if\ndey knowed whar dey wuz hidin', 'waitin' to cotch a Nigger. Dey would\ngit hot ashes an' dash over 'em, an' dem patterollers dey sho' would\nrun, but de slaves would git worse dan dat, if dey was cotched.\n\n\n\"Miss, in slav'ry time when Niggers come from de fields at night dey\nwarn't no frolickin'. Dey jus' went to sleep. De mens wukked all day\nSadday, but de 'omans knocked off at twelve o'clock to wash an' sich\nlak.\n\n\n\"Christmas times dey give us a week off an' brung us a little candy an'\nstuff 'roun'. Not much, not much. On New Year's Day us had to git back\non de job.\n\n\n\"Chilluns what wuz big enough to wuk didn't have time in week days to\nplay no games on Marse Bostwick's place. On Sunday us played wid marbles\nmade out of clay, but dat's all. I heered my ma sing a little song to de\nbaby what soun' lak dis:\n\n\n  'Hush little baby\n   Don't you cry\n   You'll be an angel\n   Bye-an'-bye.'\n\n\n\"Yes Ma'am, dere wuz one thing dey wuz good 'bout. When de Niggers got\nsick dey sont for de doctor. I heered 'em say dey biled jimson weeds an'\nmade tea for colds, an' rhubarb tea wuz to cure worms in chillun. I wuz\ntoo young to be bothered 'bout witches an' charms, Rawhead an' Bloody\nBones an' sich. I didn't take it in.\n\n\n\"When de Yankees come thoo' an' 'lowed us wuz free, us thought dey wuz\njus' dem patterollers, an' us made for de woods. Dey tole us to come\nout, dat us wuz free Niggers. Marster Berry said: 'You dam Niggers am\nfree. You don't b'long to me no more.'\n\n\n\"Us married long time atter de War, an' us had a little feast: cake,\nwine, fried chicken, an' ham, an' danced 'til 'mos' daybreak. I 'members\nhow good she looked wid dat pretty dove colored dress, all trimmed wid\nlace. Us didn't have no chillun. She wuz lak a tree what's sposen to\nbear fruit an' don't. She died 'bout thirteen years ago.\n\n\n\"When de Ku Kluxers come thoo', us chillun thought de devil wuz atter us\nfor sho'. I wuz sich a young chap I didn't take in what dey said 'bout\nMr. Abyham Lincoln, an' Mr. Jeff Davis. Us would a been slaves 'til yit,\nif Mr. Lincoln hadn't sot us free. Dey wuz bofe of 'em, good mens. I\nsho' had ruther be free. Who wants a gun over 'em lak a prisoner? A\npusson is better off dead.\n\n\n\"I jined de church 'cause dis is a bad place at de bes' an' dere's so\nmany mean folkses, what's out to seem good an' ain't. An' if you serve\nGod in de right way, I'se sho' when you die he'll give you a place to\nrest for evermore. An' 'cordin' to my notion dat's de way evvybody\noughta live.\"\n\n\nIn conclusion, Alec said: \"I don't want to talk no more. I'se\ndisappointed, I thought sho' you wuz one of dem pension ladies what come\nfor to fetch me some money. I sho' wish dey would come. Good-bye Miss.\"\nThen he hobbled into the house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarragan-Harris\n[TR: Miss Maude Barragan (interviewer), Mrs. Leila Harris (editor)]\n\n\nNANCY BOUDRY, THOMSON, GEORGIA\n\n\n\n\n\"If I ain't a hunnard,\" said Nancy, nodding her white-turbaned head, \"I\nsho' is close to it, 'cause I got a grandson 50 years old.\"\n\n\nNancy's silky white hair showed long and wavy under her headband. Her\ngingham dress was clean, and her wrinkled skin was a reddish-yellow\ncolor, showing a large proportion of Indian and white blood. Har eyes\nware a faded blue.\n\n\n\"I speck I is mos' white,\" acknowledged Nancy, \"but I ain't never knowed\nwho my father was. My mother was a dark color.\"\n\n\nThe cottage faced the pine grove behind an old church. Pink ramblers\ngrew everywhere, and the sandy yard was neatly kept. Nancy's paralyzed\ngranddaughter-in-law hovered in the doorway, her long smooth braids\nhanging over Indian-brown shoulders, a loose wrapper of dark blue denim\nflowing around her tall unsteady figure. She was eager to taka part in\nthe conversation but hampered by a thick tongue induced, as Nancy put\nit, \"by a bad sore throat she ain't got over.\"\n\n\nNancy's recollections of plantation days were colored to a somber hue by\noverwork, childbearing, poor food and long working hours.\n\n\n\"Master was a hard taskmaster,\" said Nancy. \"My husband didn't live on\nde same plantation where I was, de Jerrell places in Columbia County. He\nnever did have nuthin' to give me 'cause he never got nuthin'. He had to\ncome and ask my white folks for me. Dey had to carry passes everywhere\ndey went, if dey didn't, dey'd git in trouble.\n\n\n\"I had to work hard, plow and go and split wood jus' like a man.\nSometimes dey whup me. Dey whup me bad, pull de cloes off down to de\nwais'--my master did it, our folks didn' have overseer.\n\n\n\"We had to ask 'em to let us go to ohurch. Went to white folks church,\n'tell de black folks get one of dere own. No'm I dunno how to read.\nNever had no schools at all, didn' 'low us to pick up a piece paper and\nlook at it.\"\n\n\n\"Nancy, wasn't your mistress kind to you?\"\n\n\n\"Mistis was sorta kin' to me, sometimes. But dey only give me meat and\nbread, didn' give me nothin' good--I ain' gwine tell no story. I had a\nheap to undergo wid. I had to scour at night at de Big House--two planks\none night, two more de nex'. De women peoples spun at night and reeled,\nso many cuts a night. Us had to git up befo' daybreak be ready to go to\nde fiel's.\n\n\n\"My master didn' have but three cullud people, dis yuh was what I stayed\nwid, my young master, had not been long married and dus' de han's dey\ngive him when he marry was all he had.\n\n\n\"Didn' have no such house as dis,\" Nancy looked into the open door of\nthe comfortable octtage, \"sometimes dey have a house built, it would be\ndaubed. Dus' one family, didn' no two families double up.\"\n\n\n\"But the children had a good time, didn't they? They played games?\"\n\n\n\"Maybe dey did play ring games, I never had no time to see what games my\nchillus play, I work so hard. Heap o' little chillun slep' on de flo'.\nNever had no frolics neither, no ma'm, and didn' go to none. We would\nhave prayer meetings on Saturday nights, and one might in de week us had\na chairback preacher, and sometimes a regular preacher would come in.\"\n\n\nNancy did not remember ever having seen the Patterollers.\n\n\n\"I hearn talk of 'em you know, heap o' times dey come out and make out\nlike dey gwine shoot you at night, dey mus' been Patterollers, dey was\ngettin' hold of a heap of 'em.\"\n\n\n\"What did you do about funerals, Nancy?\"\n\n\n\"Dey let us knock off for funerals, I tell de truth. Us stay up all\nnight, singin' and prayin'. Dey make de coffin outter pine boards.\"\n\n\n\"Did you suffer during the war?\"\n\n\n\"We done de bes' we could, we et what we could get, sometimes didn' have\nnothin' to eat but piece of cornbread, but de white folks allus had\nchicken.\"\n\n\n\"But you had clothes to wear?\"\n\n\n\"Us had clothes 'cause we spun de thread and weaved 'em. Dey bought dem\ndere great big ole brogans where you couldn' hardly walk in 'em. Not\nlike dese shoes I got on.\" Nancy thrust out her foot, easy in \"Old\nLadies' Comforts.\"\n\n\n\"When they told you were free, Nancy, did the master appear to be\nangry?\"\n\n\n\"No'm, white folks didn' 'pear to be mad. My master dus' tole us we was\nfree. Us moved right off, but not so far I couldn' go backwards and\nforwards to see 'um.\" (So it was evident that even if Nancy's life had\nbeen hard, there was a bond between her and her former owners.) \"I didn'\ndo no mo' work for 'um, I work for somebody else. Us rented land and\nmade what we could, so we could have little somethin' to eat. I scoured\nand waited on white people in town, got little piece of money, and was\ndus' as proud!\"\n\n\nNancy savored the recollection of her first earned money a moment,\nthinking back to the old days.\n\n\n\"I had a preacher for my second marriage,\" she continued, \"Fo' chillun\ndied on me--one girl, de yuthers was babies. White doctor tended me.\"\n\n\nAsked about midwifery, Nancy smiled.\n\n\n\"I was a midwife myself, to black and white, after freedom. De Thomson\ndoctors all liked me and tole people to 'git Nancy.' I used 'tansy\ntea'--heap o' little root--made black pepper tea, fotch de pains on 'em.\nWhen I would git to de place where I had a hard case, I would send for\nde doctor, and he would help me out, yes, doctor help me out of all of\n'em.\"\n\n\nAsked about signs and superstitions, Nancy nodded.\n\n\n\"I have seed things. Day look dus' like a person, walkin' in de woods. I\nwould look off and look back to see it again and it be gone.\" Nancy\nlowered her voice mysteriously, and looked back into the little room\nwhere Vanna's unsteady figure moved from bed to chair. \"I seed a coffin\nfloatin' in de air in dat room--\" she shivered, \"and I heard a heap o'\nknockings. I dunno what it bees--but de sounds come in de house. I runs\nev'y squeech owl away what comes close, too.\" Nancy clasped her hands,\nright thumb over left thumb, \"does dat--and it goes on away--dey quits\nhollerin', you chokin' 'em when you does dat.\"\n\n\n\"Do you plant by the moon, Nancy?\"\n\n\n\"Plant when de moon change, my garden, corn, beans. I planted some beans\nonce on de wrong time of de moon and dey didn' bear nothing--I hated it\nso bad, I didn' know what to do, so I been mindful ever since when I\nplant. Women peoples come down on de moon, too. I ain't know no signs to\nraise chillun. I whup mine when dey didn' do right, I sho' did. I didn'\n'low my chillun to take nothin'--no aigs and nothin' 'tall and bring 'em\nto my house. I say 'put dem right whar you git 'em.\"\n\n\n\"Did you sing spirituals, Nancy?\"\n\n\n\"I sang regular meetin' songs,\" she said, \"like 'lay dis body down' and\n'let yo' joys be known'--but I can't sing now, not any mo'.\"\n\n\nNancy was proud of her quilt-making ability.\n\n\n\"Git 'um, Vanna, let de ladies see 'um,\" she said; and when Vanna\nbrought the gay pieces made up in a \"double-burst\" (sunburst) pattern,\nNancy fingered the squares with loving fingers. \"Hit's pooty, ain't it?\"\nshe asked wistfully, \"I made one for a white lady two years ago, but dey\nhurts my fingers now--makes 'em stiff.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLKLORE INTERVIEW\n\n\nALICE BRADLEY\nHull Street near Corner of Hoyt Street\nAthens, Georgia\n\n\nKIZZIE COLQUITT\n243 Macon Avenue\nAthens, Georgia\n\n\nWritten by:\nMiss Grace McCune\nAthens, Georgia\n\n\nEdited by:\nMrs. Leila Harris\nEditor\nFederal Writers' Project\nAugusta, Georgia\n[APR 20 1938]\n\n\n[TR: These two interviews were filed together, though not recorded at\nthe same place or time.]\n\n\n\n\nAlice Bradley\n\n\nAlice Bradley, or \"Aunt Alice\" as she is known to everybody, \"runs\ncards\" and claims to be a seeress.

Dixon [HW: (Colored)]\n[JUL 28 1937]\n\n\n\n\nDella Briscoe, now living in Macon, is a former slave of Mr. David Ross,\nwho owned a large plantation in Putnam County. Della, when a very tiny\nchild, was carried there with her father and mother, Sam and Mary Ross.\nSoon after their arrival the mother was sent to work at the \"big house\"\nin Eatonton. This arrangement left Della, her brother and sister to the\ncare of their grandmother, who really posed as their mother. The\nchildren grew up under the impression that their mother was an older\nsister and did not know the truth until just after the close of the\nCivil War, when the mother became seriously ill and called the children\nto her bedside to tell them goodbye.\n\n\nMr. David Ross had a large family and was considered the richest planter\nin the county. Nearly every type of soil was found on his vast estate,\ncomposed of hilly sections as well as acres of lowlands. The highway\nentering Eatonton divided the plantation and, down this road every\nFriday, Della's father drove the wagon to town with a supply of fresh\nbutter, for Mrs. Ross' thirty head of cows supplied enough milk to\nfurnish the city dwellers with butter.\n\n\nRefrigeration was practically unknown, so a well was used to keep the\nbutter fresh. This cool well was eighty feet deep and passed through a\nlayer of solid rock. A rope ladder was suspended from the mouth of the\nwell to the place where the butter was lowered for preservation. For\nsafety, and to shield it from the sun, reeds were planted all around the\nwell. And as they grew very tall, a stranger would not suspect a well\nbeing there.\n\n\nIn addition to marketing, Della's father trapped beavers which were\nplentiful in the swampy part of the plantation bordering the Oconee,\nselling their pelts to traders in the nearby towns of Augusta and\nSavannah, where Mr. Ross also marketed his cotton and large quantities\nof corn. Oxen, instead of mules, were used to make the trips to market\nand return, each trip consuming six or seven days.\n\n\nThe young children were assigned small tasks, such as piling brush in\n\"new grounds\", carrying water to field hands, and driving the calves to\npasture.\n\n\nPunishment was administered, though not as often as on some plantations.\nThe little girl, Della, was whipped only once--for breaking up a\nturkey's nest she had found. Several were accused of this, and because\nthe master could not find the guilty party, he whipped each of the\nchildren.\n\n\nCrime was practically unknown and Mr. Ross' slaves never heard of a jail\nuntil they were freed.\n\n\nMen were sometimes placed in \"bucks\", which meant they were laid across\nblocks with their hands and feet securely tied. An iron bar was run\nbetween the blocks to prevent any movement; then, after being stripped,\nthey were whipped. Della said that she knew of but one case of this\ntype of punishment being administered a Ross slave. Sickness was\nnegligible--childbirth being practically the only form of a Negro\nwoman's \"coming down\".\n\n\nAs a precaution against disease, a tonic was given each slave every\nspring. Three were also, every spring, taken from the field each day\nuntil every one had been given a dose of calomel and salts. Mr. Ross\nonce bought two slaves who became ill with smallpox soon after their\narrival. They were isolated in a small house located in the center of a\nfield, while one other slave was sent there to nurse them. All three\nwere burned to death when their hut was destroyed by fire.\n\n\nIn case of death, even on a neighboring place, all work was suspended\nuntil the dead was buried.\n\n\nSunday, the only day of rest, was often spent in attending religious\nservices, and because these were irregularly held, brush arbor meetings\nwere common. This arbor was constructed of a brush roof supported by\nposts and crude joists. The seats were usually made of small saplings\nnailed to short stumps.\n\n\nReligion was greatly stressed and every child was christened shortly\nafter its birth. An adult who desired to join the church went first to\nthe master to obtain his permission. He was then sent to the home of a\nminister who lived a short distance away at a place called Flat Rock.\nHere, his confession was made and, at the next regular service, he was\nformally received into the church.\n\n\nCourtships were brief.\n\n\nThe \"old man\", who was past the age for work and only had to watch what\nwent on at the quarters, was usually the first to notice a budding\nfriendship, which he reported to the master. The couple was then\nquestioned and, if they consented, were married without the benefit of\nclergy.\n\n\nFood was distributed on Monday night, and for each adult slave the\nfollowing staple products were allowed--\n\n\n    Weekly ration:                On Sunday:\n  3-1/2 lbs. meat               One qt. syrup\n  1 pk. of meal                 One gal. flour\n  1 gal. shorts                 One cup lard\n\n\nVegetables, milk, etc., could be obtained at the \"big house\", but fresh\nmeat and chickens were never given. The desire for these delicacies\noften overcame the slaves' better natures, and some frequently went\nnight foraging for small shoats and chickens.\n\n\nThe \"old man\" kept account of the increase or decrease in live stock and\npoultry and reported anything missing each day. When suspicion fell on a\nvisitor of the previous night, this information was given to his master,\nwho then searched the accused's dinner pail and cabin. If meat was found\nin either the culprit was turned over to his accuser for punishment.\nAfter being whipped, he was forbidden for three months to visit the\nplantation where he had committed the theft.\n\n\nOne of Della's grandmother's favorite recipes was made of dried beef and\nwheat. The wheat was brought from the field and husked by hand. This,\nadded to the rapidly boiling beef, was cooked until a mush resulted,\nwhich was then eaten from wooden bowls with spoons of the same material.\nWhite plates were never used by the slaves.\n\n\nCloth for clothing was woven on the place. Della's grandmother did most\nof the spinning, and she taught her child to spin when she was so small\nthat she had to stand on a raised plank to reach the wheel. After the\ncloth was spun it was dyed with dye made from \"shoemake\" (sumac) leaves,\ngreen walnuts, reeds, and copperas. One person cut and others sewed. The\ndresses for women were straight, like slips, and the garments of the\nsmall boys resembled night shirts. If desired, a bias fold of\ncontrasting colour was placed at the waist line or at the bottom of\ndresses. The crudely made garments were starched with a solution of\nflour or meal and water which was strained and then boiled.\n\n\nAs a small child Della remembers hearing a peculiar knock on the door\nduring the night, and a voice which replied to queries, \"No one to hurt\nyou, but keep that red flannel in your mouth. Have you plenty to eat?\nDon't worry; you'll be free.\" No one would ever tell, if they knew, to\nwhom this voice belonged.\n\n\nJust before the beginning of the Civil War a comet appeared which was so\nbright that the elder people amused themselves by sitting on the rail\nfence and throwing pins upon the ground where the reflection was cast.\nThe children scrambled madly to see who could find the most pins.\n\n\nDuring the early part of the war Mr. Ross fought with the Confederates,\nleaving his young son, Robert, in charge of his affairs. The young\nmaster was very fond of horses and his favorite horse--\"Bill\"--was\ntrained to do tricks. One of these was to lie down when tickled on his\nflanks. The Yankees visited the plantation and tried to take this\nhorse. Robert, who loved him dearly, refused to dismount, and as they\nwere about to shoot the horse beneath him, the slaves began to plead.\nThey explained that the boy was kind to every one and devoted to\nanimals, after which explanation, he was allowed to keep his horse.\n\n\nThe breastworks at Savannah required many laborers to complete their\nconstruction, and as the commanders desired to save the strength of\ntheir soldiers, slave labor was solicited. Two slaves from each nearby\nplantation were sent to work for a limited number of days. The round\ntrip from the Ross plantation required seven days.\n\n\nNearly every man had a family and when they returned from these long\ntrips they drove to the quarters and fell on their knees to receive the\nwelcome caresses of their small children.\n\n\nRecreational facilities were not provided and slave children had little\nknowledge of how to play. Their two main amusements were building frog\nhouses and sliding down a steep bank on a long board. One day, as they\nplayed up and down the highway, building frog houses at irregular\nintervals, little Della looked up and saw a group of Yankee calvarymen\napproaching. She screamed and began running and so attracted the\nattention of Mr. Ross who was at home on a furlough.\n\n\nHe saw the men in time to find a hiding place. Meanwhile, the soldiers\narrived and the leader, springing from his horse, snatched Della up and\nspanked her soundly for giving the alarm, as they had hoped to take her\nmaster by surprise. Della said this was the first \"white slap\" she ever\nreceived.\n\n\nSome of the Yankees entered the house, tore up the interior, and threw\nthe furniture out doors. Another group robbed the smokehouse and smashed\nso many barrels of syrup that it ran in a stream through the yard. They\ncarried much of the meat off with them and gave the remainder to the\nslaves. Chickens were caught, dressed, and fried on the spot as each\nsoldier carried his own frying pan, and a piece of flint rock and a\nsponge with which to make a fire. The men were skilled in dressing fowls\nand cleaned them in a few strokes.\n\n\nWhen they had eaten as much as they desired, a search for the corral was\nmade, but the mules were so well hidden that they were not able to find\nthem. Della's father's hands were tied behind him and he was then forced\nto show them the hiding place. These fine beasts, used for plowing, were\nnamed by the slaves who worked them. Characteristic names were: \"Jule\",\n\"Pigeon\", \"Little Deal\", \"Vic\", (the carriage horse), \"Streaked leg,\"\n\"Kicking Kid\", \"Sore-back Janie\". Every one was carried off.\n\n\nThis raid took place on Christmas Eve and the slaves were frantic as\nthey had been told that Yankees were mean people, especially was Sherman\nso pictured.\n\n\nWhen Sherman had gone, Mr. Ross came from his hiding place in the \"cool\nwell\" and spoke to his slaves. To the elder ones he said, \"I saw you\ngive away my meat and mules.\"\n\n\n\"Master, we were afraid. We didn't want to do it, but we were afraid not\nto.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, I understand that you could not help yourselves.\" He then turned\nto the children, saying, \"Bless all of you, but to little Della, I owe\nmy life. From now on she shall never be whipped, and she shall have a\nhome of her own for life.\"\n\n\nShe shook with laughter as she said, \"Master thought I screamed to warn\nhim and I was only frightened.\"\n\n\nTrue to his word, after freedom he gave her a three-acre plot of land\nupon which he built a house and added a mule, buggy, cow, hogs, etc.\nDella lived there until after her marriage, when she had to leave with\nher husband. She later lost her home. Having been married twice, she now\nbears the name of Briscoe, her last husband's name.\n\n\nWhen the family had again settled down to the ordinary routine, a new\nplague, body lice, said to have been left by the invaders, made life\nalmost unbearable for both races.\n\n\nDella now lives with her granddaughter, for she has been unable to work\nfor twenty-eight years. Macon's Department of Public Welfare assists in\ncontributing to her livelihood, as the granddaughter can only pay the\nroom rent.\n\n\nShe does not know her age but believes that she is above ninety. Her\nkeen old eyes seemed to look back into those bygone days as she said, \"I\ngot along better den dan I eber hab since.

His colored friends are also of the opinion that he\nis fully that old or older--but, since none of his former (two) owners'\npeople can be located, and no records concerning his birth can be found,\nhis definite age cannot be positively established.\n\n\n\"Uncle\" George claims to have worked in the fields, \"some\", the year the\n\"stars fell\"--1833.\n\n\nHis original owner was Mr. Henry Williams--to whom he was greatly\nattached. As a young man, he was--for a number of years--Mr. Williams'\npersonal body-servant. After Mr. Williams' death--during the 1850's,\n\"Uncle\" George was sold to a white man--whose name he doesn't\nremember--of Dadeville, Alabama, with whom he subsequently spent five\nmonths in the Confederate service.\n\n\nOne of \"Uncle\" George's stories is to the effect that he once left a\nchore he was doing for his second \"Marster's\" wife, \"stepped\" to a\nnearby well to get a drink of water and, impelled by some strange,\nirresistible \"power\", \"jes kep on walkin 'til he run slap-dab inter de\nYankees\", who corraled him and kept him for three months.\n\n\nStill another story he tells is that of his being sold after freedom!\nAccording to his version of this incident, he was sold along with two\nbales of cotton in the fall of 1865--either the cotton being sold and he\n\"thrown in\" with it, or vice versa--he doesn't know which, but he _does\nknow_ that he and the cotton were \"sold\" together! And very soon after\nthis transaction occurred, the seller was clapped in jail! Then,\n\"somebody\" (he doesn't remember who) gave him some money, put him on a\nstage-coach at night and \"shipped\" him to Columbus, where he learned\nthat he was a free man and has since remained.\n\n\n\"Uncle\" George has been married once and is the father of several\nchildren. His wife, however, died fifty-odd years ago and he knows\nnothing of the whereabouts of his children--doesn't even know whether or\nnot any of them are living, having lost \"all track o'all kin fokes too\nlong ago to tawk about.\"\n\n\nUnfortunately, \"Uncle\" George's mind is clouded and his memory badly\nimpaired, otherwise his life story would perhaps be quite interesting.\nFor more than twenty years, he has been supported and cared for by kind\nhearted members of his race, who say that they intend to continue \"to\nlook after the old man 'til he passes on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEX-SLAVE INTERVIEW\n\n\nEASTER BROWN\n1020 S. Lumpkin Street\nAthens, Georgia\n\n\nWritten By:\nMrs. Sadie B. Hornsby\n\n\nEdited By:\nJohn N. Booth\nFederal Writers' Project\nWPA Residency No. 7\n\n\n\n\n\"Aunt\" Easter Brown, 78 years old, was sweeping chips into a basket out\nin front of her cabin. \"Go right in honey, I'se comin' soon as I git\nsome chips for my fire. Does I lak to talk 'bout when I wuz a chile? I\nsho does. I warn't but 4 years old when de war wuz over, but I knows all\n'bout it.\"\n\n\n\"I wuz born in Floyd County sometime in October. My pa wuz Erwin and my\nma wuz Liza Lorie. I don't know whar dey come from, but I knows dey wuz\nfrom way down de country somewhars. Dere wuz six of us chilluns. All of\nus wuz sold. Yessum, I wuz sold too. My oldest brother wuz named Jim. I\ndon't riccolec' de others, dey wuz all sold off to diffunt parts of de\ncountry, and us never heared from 'em no more. My brother, my pa and me\nwuz sold on de block in Rome, Georgia. Marster Frank Glenn buyed me. I\nwuz so little dat when dey bid me off, dey had to hold me up so folkses\ncould see me. I don't 'member my real ma and pa, and I called Marster\n'pa' an' Mist'ess 'ma', 'til I wuz 'bout 'leven years old.\n\n\n\"I don't know much 'bout slave quarters, or what dey had in 'em, 'cause\nI wuz raised in de house wid de white folkses. I does know beds in de\nquarters wuz lak shelves. Holes wuz bored in de side of de house, two in\nde wall and de floor, and poles runnin' from de wall and de floor,\nfastened together wid pegs; on 'em dey put planks, and cross de foot of\nde bed dey put a plank to hold de straw and keep de little 'uns from\nfallin' out.\n\n\n\"What did us have to eat? Lordy mussy! Mist'ess! us had everything.\nSummertime dere wuz beans, cabbage, squashes, irish 'tatoes, roas'en\nears, 'matoes, cucumbers, cornbread, and fat meat, but de Nigger boys,\ndey wuz plum fools 'bout hog head. In winter dey et sweet 'tatoes,\ncollards, turnips and sich, but I et lak de white folkses. I sho does\nlak 'possums and rabbits. Yessum, some of de slaves had gyardens, some\nof 'em sholy did.\n\n\n\"No'm, us Niggers never wore no clothes in summer, I means us little\n'uns. In de winter us wore cotton clothes, but us went barefoots. My\nuncle Sam and some of de other Niggers went 'bout wid dey foots popped\nopen from de cold. Marster had 110 slaves on his plantation.\n\n\n\"Mist'ess wuz good to me. Pa begged her to buy me, 'cause she wuz his\nyoung Mist'ess and he knowed she would be good to me, but Marster wuz\nreal cruel. He'd beat his hoss down on his knees and he kilt one of 'em.\nHe whupped de Niggers when dey didn't do right. Niggers is lak dis; dey\nwuz brought to dis here land wild as bucks, and dey is lak chicken\nroosters in a pen. You just have to make 'em 'have deyselves. Its lak\ndat now; if dey'd 'have deyselves, white folkses would let 'em be.\n\n\n\"Dere warn't no jails in dem days. Dey had a gyuard house what dey\nwhupped 'em in, and Mondays and Tuesdays wuz set aside for de whuppin's,\nwhen de Niggers what had done wrong got so many lashes, 'cordin' to what\ndevilment dey had been doin'. De overseer didn't do de whuppin',\nMarster done dat. Dem patterrollers wuz sompin else. Mankind! If dey\nketched a Nigger out atter dark widout no pass dey'd most nigh tear de\nhide offen his back.\n\n\n\"I'll tell you what dat overseer done one night. Some enemy of Marster's\nsot fire to de big frame house whar him and Mist'ess and de chillun\nlived. De overseer seed it burnin', and run and clam up de tree what wuz\nclose to de house, went in de window and got Marster's two little gals\nout dat burnin' house 'fore you could say scat. Dat sho fixed de\noverseer wid old Marster. Atter dat Marster give him a nice house to\nlive in but Marster's fine old house sho wuz burnt to de ground.\n\n\n\"De cyarriage driver wuz uncle Sam. He drove de chillun to school, tuk\nMarster and Mist'ess to church, and done de wuk 'round de house; such\nas, totin' in wood, keepin' de yards and waitin' on de cook. No'm us\nslaves didn't go to church; de Niggers wuz so wore out on Sundays, dey\nwuz glad to stay home and rest up, 'cause de overseer had 'em up way\n'fore day and wuked 'em 'til long atter dark. On Saddays dey had to wash\ndeir clothes and git ready for de next week. Some slaves might a had\nspecial things give to 'em on Christmas and New Years Day, but not on\nMarster's plantation; dey rested up a day and dat wuz all. I heared tell\ndey had Christmas fixin's and doin's on other plantations, but not on\nMarse Frank's place. All corn shuckin's, cotton pickin's, log rollin's,\nand de lak was when de boss made 'em do it, an' den dere sho warn't no\nextra sompin t'eat.\n\n\n\"De onliest game I ever played wuz to take my doll made out of a stick\nwid a rag on it and play under a tree. When I wuz big 'nough to wuk, all\nI done wuz to help de cook in de kitchen and play wid old Mist'ess'\nbaby.\n\n\n\"Some of de Niggers runned away. Webster, Hagar, Atney, an' Jane runned\naway a little while 'fore freedom. Old Marster didn't try to git 'em\nback, 'cause 'bout dat time de war wuz over. Marster and Mist'ess sho\nlooked atter de Niggers when dey got sick for dey knowed dat if a Nigger\ndied dat much property wuz lost. Yessum, dey had a doctor sometime, but\nde most dey done wuz give 'em hoarhound, yellow root and tansy. When a\nbaby wuz cuttin' teeth, dey biled ground ivy and give 'em.\n\n\n\"Louisa, de cook wuz married in de front yard. All I 'members 'bout it\nwuz dat all de Niggers gathered in de yard, Louisa had on a white dress;\nde white folkses sho fixed Louisa up, 'cause she wuz deir cook.\n\n\n\"Jus' lemme tell you 'bout my weddin' I buyed myself a dress and had it\nlaid out on de bed, den some triflin', no 'count Nigger wench tuk and\nstole it 'fore I had a chance to git married in it. I had done buyed dat\ndress for two pupposes; fust to git married in it, and second to be\nburied in. I stayed on wid Old Miss 'til I got 'bout grown and den I\ndrifted to Athens. When I married my fust husband, Charlie Montgomery, I\nwuz wukkin' for Mrs. W.R. Booth, and us married in her dinin' room.\nCharlie died out and I married James Hoshier. Us had one baby. Hit wuz a\nboy. James an' our boy is both daid now and I'se all by myself.\n\n\n\"What de slaves done when dey wuz told dat dey wuz free? I wuz too\nlittle to know what dey meant by freedom, but Old Marster called de\noverseer and told him to ring de bell for de Niggers to come to de big\nhouse. He told 'em dey wuz free devils and dey could go whar dey pleased\nand do what dey pleased--dey could stay wid him if dey wanted to. Some\nstayed wid Old Marster and some went away. I never seed no yankee\nsojers. I heared tell of 'em comin' but I never seed none of 'em.\n\n\n\"No'm I don't know nothin' 'bout Abraham Lincoln, Booker T. Washington\nor Jefferson Davis. I didn't try to ketch on to any of 'em. As for\nslavery days; some of de Niggers ought to be free and some oughtn't to\nbe. I don't know nuttin much 'bout it. I had a good time den, and I gits\non pretty good now.\n\n\n\"How come I jined de church? Well I felt lak it wuz time for me to live\nbetter and git ready for a home in de next world. Chile you sho has axed\nme a pile of questions, and I has sho 'joyed tellin' you what I knowed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJULIA BROWN (Aunt Sally)\n710 Griffin Place, N.W.\nAtlanta, Ga.\nJuly 25, 1936[TR:?]\n\n\nby\nGeneva Tonsill\n\n\n[TR: One page of this interview was repeated in typescript; where there\nwas a discrepancy, the clearer version was used.]\n\n\n\n\nAH ALWAYS HAD A HARD TIME\n\n\nAunt Sally rocked back and forth incessantly. She mopped her wrinkled\nface with a dirty rag as she talked. \"Ah wuz born fo' miles frum\nCommerce, Georgia, and wuz thirteen year ole at surrender. Ah belonged\nto the Nash fambly--three ole maid sisters. My mama belonged to the\nNashes and my papa belonged to General Burns; he wuz a officer in the\nwar. There wuz six of us chilluns, Lucy, Malvina, Johnnie, Callie, Joe\nand me. We didn't stay together long, as we wuz give out to different\npeople. The Nashes didn't believe in selling slaves but we wuz known as\ntheir niggers. They sold one once 'cause the other slaves said they\nwould kill him 'cause he had a baby by his own daughter. So to keep him\nfrum bein' kilt, they sold him.\n\n\n\"My mama died the year of surrender. Ah didn't fare well after her\ndeath, Ah had sicha hard time. Ah wuz give to the Mitchell fambly and\nthey done every cruel thing they could to me. Ah slept on the flo' nine\nyears, winter and summer, sick or well. Ah never wore anything but a\ncotton dress, a shimmy and draw's. That 'oman didn't care what happened\nto the niggers. Sometimes she would take us to church. We'd walk to the\nchurch house. Ah never went nowhere else. That 'oman took delight in\nsellin' slaves. She'd lash us with a cowhide whip. Ah had to shift fur\nmahself.\n\n\n\"They didn't mind the slaves matin', but they wanted their niggers to\nmarry only amongst them on their place. They didn't 'low 'em to mate\nwith other slaves frum other places. When the wimmen had babies they wuz\ntreated kind and they let 'em stay in. We called it 'lay-in', just about\nlak they do now. We didn't go to no horspitals as they do now, we jest\nhad our babies and had a granny to catch 'em. We didn't have all the\npain-easin' medicines then. The granny would put a rusty piece of tin or\na ax under the mattress and this would ease the pains. The granny put a\nax under my mattress once. This wuz to cut off the after-pains and it\nsho did too, honey. We'd set up the fifth day and after the 'layin-in'\ntime wuz up we wuz 'lowed to walk out doors and they tole us to walk\naround the house jest once and come in the house. This wuz to keep us\nfrum takin' a 'lapse.\n\n\n\"We wuzn't 'lowed to go around and have pleasure as the folks does\ntoday. We had to have passes to go wherever we wanted. When we'd git out\nthere wuz a bunch of white men called the 'patty rollers'. They'd come\nin and see if all us had passes and if they found any who didn't have a\npass he wuz whipped; give fifty or more lashes--and they'd count them\nlashes. If they said a hundred you got a hundred. They wuz somethin' lak\nthe Klu Klux. We wuz 'fraid to tell our masters about the patty rollers\nbecause we wuz skeered they'd whip us again, fur we wuz tole not to\ntell. They'd sing a little ditty. Ah wish Ah could remember the words,\nbut it went somethin' lak this:\n\n\n  'Run, Niggah, run, de Patty Rollers'll git you,\n   Run Niggah, ran, you'd bettah git away.'\n\n\n\"We wuz 'fraid to go any place.\n\n\n\"Slaves ware treated in most cases lak cattle. A man went about the\ncountry buyin' up slaves lak buyin' up cattle and the like, and he wuz\ncalled a 'speculator', then he'd sell 'em to the highest bidder. Oh! it\nwuz pitiful to see chil'en taken frum their mothers' breast, mothers\nsold, husbands sold frum wives. One 'oman he wuz to buy had a baby, and\nof course the baby come befo' he bought her and he wouldn't buy the\nbaby; said he hadn't bargained to buy the baby too, and he jest\nwouldn't. My uncle wuz married but he wuz owned by one master and his\nwife wuz owned by another. He wuz 'lowed to visit his wife on Wednesday\nand Saturday, that's the onliest time he could git off. He went on\nWednesday and when he went back on Saturday his wife had been bought by\nthe speculator and he never did know where she wuz.\n\n\n\"Ah worked hard always. Honey, you can't 'magine what a hard time Ah\nhad. Ah split rails lak a man. How did Ah do it? Ah used a huge glut,\nand a iron wedge drove into the wood with a maul, and this would split\nthe wood.\n\n\n\"Ah help spin the cotton into thread fur our clothes. The thread wuz\nmade into big broaches--four broaches made four cuts, or one hank. After\nthe thread wuz made we used a loom to weave the cloth. We had no sewin'\nmachine--had to sew by hand. My mistress had a big silver bird and she\nwould always catch the cloth in the bird's bill and this would hold it\nfur her to sew.\n\n\n\"Ah didn't git to handle money when I wuz young. Ah worked frum sunup to\nsundown. We never had overseers lak some of the slaves. We wuz give so\nmuch work to do in a day and if the white folks went off on a vacation\nthey would give us so much work to do while they wuz gone and we better\nhave all of that done too when they'd come home. Some of the white folks\nwuz very kind to their slaves. Some did not believe in slavery and some\nfreed them befo' the war and even give 'em land and homes. Some would\ngive the niggers meal, lard and lak that. They made me hoe when Ah wuz a\nchile and Ah'd keep rat up with the others, 'cause they'd tell me that\nif Ah got behind a run-a-way nigger would git me and split open my head\nand git the milk out'n it. Of course Ah didn't know then that wuzn't\ntrue--Ah believed everything they tole me and that made me work the\nharder.\n\n\n\"There wuz a white man, Mister Jim, that wuz very mean to the slaves.\nHe'd go 'round and beat 'em. He'd even go to the little homes, tear down\nthe chimneys and do all sorts of cruel things. The chimneys wuz made of\nmud 'n straw 'n sticks; they wuz powerful strong too. Mister Jim wuz\njest a mean man, and when he died we all said God got tired of Mister\nJim being so mean and kilt him. When they laid him out on the coolin'\nboard, everybody wuz settin' 'round, moanin' over his death, and all of\na sudden Mister Jim rolled off'n the coolin' board, and sich a runnin'\nand gittin' out'n that room you never saw. We said Mister Jim wuz tryin'\nto run the niggers and we wuz 'fraid to go about at night. Ah believed\nit then; now that they's 'mbalmin' Ah know that must have been gas and\nhe wuz purgin', fur they didn't know nothin' 'bout 'mbalmin' then. They\ndidn't keep dead folks out'n the ground long in them days.\n\n\n\"Doctors wuzn't so plentiful then. They'd go 'round in buggies and on\nhosses. Them that rode on a hoss had saddle pockets jest filled with\nlittle bottles and lots of them. He'd try one medicine and if it didn't\ndo not [TR: no?] good he'd try another until it did do good and when the\ndoctor went to see a sick pusson he'd stay rat there until he wuz\nbetter. He didn't jest come in and write a 'scription fur somebody to\ntake to a drug store. We used herbs a lots in them days. When a body had\ndropsy we'd set him in a tepid bath made of mullein leaves. There wuz a\njimson weed we'd use fur rheumatism, and fur asthma we'd use tea made of\nchestnut leaves. We'd git the chestnut leaves, dry them in the sun jest\nlak tea leaves, and we wouldn't let them leaves git wet fur nothin' in\nthe world while they wuz dryin'. We'd take poke salad roots, boil them\nand then take sugar and make a syrup. This wuz the best thing fur\nasthma. It was known to cure it too. Fur colds and sich we used\nho'hound; made candy out'n it with brown sugar. We used a lots of rock\ncandy and whiskey fur colds too. They had a remedy that they used fur\nconsumption--take dry cow manure, make a tea of this and flavor it with\nmint and give it to the sick pusson. We didn't need many doctors then\nfur we didn't have so much sickness in them days, and nachelly they\ndidn't die so fast; folks lived a long time then. They used a lot of\npeachtree leaves too for fever, and when the stomach got upsot we'd\ncrush the leaves, pour water over them and wouldn't let them drink any\nother kind of water 'till they wuz better. Ah still believes in them ole\nho'made medicines too and ah don't believe in so many doctors.\n\n\n\"We didn't have stoves plentiful then: just ovens we set in the\nfireplace. Ah's toted a many a armful of bark--good ole hickory bark to\ncook with. We'd cook light bread--both flour and corn. The yeast fur\nthis bread wuz made frum hops. Coals of fire wuz put on top of the oven\nand under the bottom, too. Everything wuz cooked on coals frum a wood\nfire--coffee and all. Wait, let me show you my coffee tribet. Have you\never seen one? Well, Ah'll show you mine.\" Aunt Sally got up and hobbled\nto the kitchen to get the trivet. After a few moments search she came\nback into the room.\n\n\n\"No, it's not there. Ah guess it's been put in the basement. Ah'll show\nit to you when you come back. It's a rack made of iron that the pot is\nset on befo' puttin' it on the fire coals. The victuals wuz good in them\ndays; we got our vegetables out'n the garden in season and didn't have\nall the hot-house vegetables. Ah don't eat many vegetables now unless\nthey come out'n the garden and I know it. Well, as I said, there wuz\nracks fitted in the fireplace to put pots on. Once there wuz a big pot\nsettin' on the fire, jest bilin' away with a big roast in it. As the\nwater biled, the meat turned over and over, comin' up to the top and\ngoin' down again, Ole Sandy, the dog, come in the kitchen. He sot there\na while and watched that meat roll over and over in the pot, and all of\na sudden-like he grabbed at that meat and pulls it out'n the pot.\n'Course he couldn't eat it 'cause it wuz hot and they got the meat befo'\nhe et it. The kitchen wuz away frum the big house, so the victuals wuz\ncooked and carried up to the house. Ah'd carry it up mahse'f. We\ncouldn't eat all the different kinds of victuals the white folks et and\none mornin' when I was carryin' the breakfast to the big house we had\nwaffles that wuz a pretty golden brown and pipin' hot. They wuz a\npicture to look at and ah jest couldn't keep frum takin' one, and that\nwuz the hardest waffle fur me to eat befo' I got to the big house I ever\nsaw. Ah jest couldn't git rid of that waffle 'cause my conscience\nwhipped me so.\n\n\n\"They taught me to do everything. Ah'd use battlin' blocks and battlin'\nsticks to wash the clothes; we all did. The clothes wuz taken out of the\nwater an put on the block and beat with a battlin' stick, which was made\nlike a paddle. On wash days you could hear them battlin' sticks poundin'\nevery which-away. We made our own soap, used ole meat and grease, and\npoured water over wood ashes which wuz kept in a rack-like thing and the\nwater would drip through the ashes. This made strong lye. We used a lot\n'o sich lye, too, to bile with.\n\n\n\"Sometimes the slaves would run away. Their masters wuz mean to them\nthat caused them to run away. Sometimes they would live in caves. How\ndid they get along? Well, chile, they got along all right--what with\nother people slippin' things in to 'em. And, too, they'd steal hogs,\nchickens, and anything else they could git their hands on. Some white\npeople would help, too, fur there wuz some white people who didn't\nbelieve in slavery. Yes, they'd try to find them slaves that run away\nand if they wuz found they'd be beat or sold to somebody else. My\ngrandmother run away frum her master. She stayed in the woods and she\nwashed her clothes in the branches. She used sand fur soap. Yes, chile,\nI reckon they got 'long all right in the caves. They had babies in thar\nand raised 'em too.\n\n\n\"Ah stayed with the Mitchells 'til Miss Hannah died. Ah even helped to\nlay her out. Ah didn't go to the graveyard though. Ah didn't have a home\nafter she died and Ah wandered from place to place, stayin' with a white\nfambly this time and then a nigger fambly the next time. Ah moved to\nJackson County and stayed with a Mister Frank Dowdy. Ah didn't stay\nthere long though. Then Ah moved to Winder, Georgia. They called it 'Jug\nTavern' in them days, 'cause jugs wuz made there. Ah married Green\nHinton in Winder. Got along well after marryin' him. He farmed fur a\nlivin' and made a good livin' fur me and the eight chilluns, all born in\nWinder. The chilluns wuz grown nearly when he died and wuz able to help\nme with the smalles ones. Ah got along all right after his death and\ndidn't have sich a hard time raisin' the chilluns. Then Ah married Jim\nBrown and moved to Atlanta. Jim farmed at first fur a livin' and then he\nworked on the railroad--the Seaboard. He helped to grade the first\nrailroad track for that line. He wuz a sand-dryer.\"\n\n\nAunt Sally broke off her story here. \"Lord, honey, Ah got sich a pain in\nmah stomach Ah don't believe Ah can go on. It's a gnawin' kind of pain.\nJest keeps me weak all over.\" Naturally I suggested that we complete the\nstory at another time. So I left, promisin' to return in a few days. A\nblock from the house I stopped in a store to order some groceries for\nAunt Sally. The proprietress, a Jewish woman, spoke up when I gave the\ndelivery address. She explained in broken English that she knew Aunt\nSally.\n\n\n\"I tink you vas very kind to do dis for Aunt Sally. She neets it. I\noften gif her son food. He's very old and feeble. He passed here\nyesterday and he look so wasted and hungry. His stomick look like it vas\ndrawn in, you know. I gif him some fresh hocks. I know dey could not eat\nall of them in a day and I'm afrait it von't be goof [TR: goot? or\ngood?] for dem today. I vas trained to help people in neet. It's pert of\nmy religion. See, if ve sit on de stritcar and an olt person comes in\nand finds no seat, ve get up and gif him one. If ve see a person loaded\nvid bundles and he iss old and barely able to go, ve gif a hand. See, ve\nJews--you colored--but ve know no difference. Anyvon neeting help, ve\ngif.\"\n\n\nA couple of days later I was back at Aunt Sally's. I had brought some\ngroceries for the old woman. I knocked a long time on the front door,\nand, getting no answer, I picked my way through the rank growth of weeds\nand grass surrounding the house and went around to the back door. It\nopened into the kitchen, where Aunt Sally and her son were having\nbreakfast. The room was small and dark and I could hardly see the\ncouple, but Aunt Sally welcomed me. \"Lawd, honey, you come right on in.\nI tole John I heard somebody knockin' at the do'.\"\n\n\n\"You been hearin' things all mornin',\" John spoke up. He turned to me.\n\"You must've been thinkin' about mamma just when we started eatin'\nbreakfast because she asked me did I hear somebody call her. I tole her\nthe Lawd Jesus is always a-callin' poor niggers, but she said it sounded\nlike the lady's voice who was here the other day. Well I didn't hear\nanything and I tole her she mus' be hearin' things.\"\n\n\nI'd put the bag of groceries on the table unobtrusively, but Aunt Sally\nwasn't one to let such gifts pass unnoticed. Eagerly she tore the bag\nopen and began pulling out the packages. \"Lawd bless you, chile, and He\nsho will bless you! I feels rich seein' what you brought me. Jest look\nat this--Lawdy mercy!--rolls, butter, milk, balogny...! Oh, this\nbalogny, jest looky there! You must a knowed what I wanted!\" She was\nstuffing it in her mouth as she talked. \"And these aigs...! Honey, you\nknows God is goin' to bless you and let you live long. Ah'se goin' to\ncook one at a time. And Ah sho been wantin' some milk. Ah'se gonna cook\nme a hoecake rat now.\"\n\n\nShe went about putting the things in little cans and placing them on\nshelves or in the dilapidated little cupboard that stood in a corner. I\nsat down near the door and listened while she rambled on.\n\n\n\"Ah used to say young people didn't care bout ole folks but Ah is takin'\nthat back now. Ah jest tole my son the other day that its turned round,\nthe young folks thinks of the ole and tries to help 'em and the ole\nfolks don't try to think of each other; some of them, they is too mean.\nAh can't understand it; Ah jest know I heard you call me when Ah started\nto eat, and tole my son so. Had you been to the do' befo'?\" She talked\non not waiting for a reply. \"Ah sho did enjoy the victuals you sent day\nbefo' yistidy. They send me surplus food frum the gove'nment but Ah\ndon't like what they send. The skim milk gripes me and Ah don't like\nthat yellow meal. A friend brought me some white meal t'other day. And\nthat wheat cereal they send! Ah eats it with water when Ah don't have\nmilk and Ah don't like it but when you don't have nothin' else you got\nto eat what you have. They send me 75\u00a2 ever two weeks but that don't go\nvery fur. Ah ain't complainin' fur Ah'm thankful fur what Ah git.\n\n\n\"They send a girl to help me around the house, too. She's frum the\nhousekeepin' department. She's very nice to me. Yes, she sho'ly is a\nsweet girl, and her foreman is sweet too. She comes in now 'n then to\nsee me and see how the girl is gittin' along. She washes, too. Ah's been\non relief a long time. Now when Ah first got on it wuz when they first\nstarted givin' me. They give me plenty of anything Ah asked fur and my\nvisitor wuz Mrs. Tompkins. She wuz so good to me. Well they stopped that\nand then the DPW (Department of Public Welfare) took care of me. When\nthey first started Ah got more than I do now and they've cut me down\n'till Ah gits only a mighty little.\n\n\n\"Yes, Ah wuz talkin' about my husband when you wuz here t'other day. He\nwuz killed on the railroad. After he moved here he bought this home.\nAh'se lived here twenty years. Jim wuz comin' in the railroad yard one\nday and stepped off the little engine they used for the workers rat in\nthe path of the L. & M. train. He wuz cut up and crushed to pieces. He\ndidn't have a sign of a head. They used a rake to git up the pieces they\ndid git. A man brought a few pieces out here in a bundle and Ah\nwouldn't even look at them. Ah got a little money frum the railroad but\nthe lawyer got most of it. He brought me a few dollars out and tole me\nnot to discuss it with anyone nor tell how much Ah got. Ah tried to git\nsome of the men that worked with him to tell me just how it all\nhappened, but they wouldn't talk, and it wuz scand'lous how them niggers\nheld their peace and wouldn't tell me anything. The boss man came out\nlater but he didn't seem intrusted in it at all, so Ah got little or\nnothing fur his death. The lawyer got it fur hisse'f.\n\n\n\"All my chilluns died 'cept my son and he is ole and sick and can't do\nnothin' fur me or hisse'f. He gets relief too, 75\u00a2 every two weeks. He\ngoes 'round and people gives him a little t'eat. He has a hard time\ntryin' to git 'long.\n\n\n\"Ah had a double bed in t'other room and let a woman have it so she\ncould git some of the delegates to the Baptist World Alliance and she\nwuz goin' to pay me fur lettin' her use the bed, but she didn't git\nanybody 'cept two. They come there on Friday and left the next day. She\nwuz tole that they didn't act right 'bout the delegates and lots of\npeople went to the expense to prepare fur them and didn't git a one. Ah\nwuz sorry, for Ah intended to use what she paid me fur my water bill. Ah\nowes $3.80 and had to give my deeds to my house to a lady to pay the\nwater bill fur me and it worries me 'cause Ah ain't got no money to pay\nit, fur this is all Ah got and Ah hates to loose my house. Ah wisht it\nwuz some way to pay it. Ah ain't been able to do fur mahse'f in many\nyears now, and has to depend on what others gives me.\n\n\n\"Tell you mo' about the ole times? Lawd, honey, times has changed so\nfrum when Ah was young. You don't hear of haints as you did when I\ngrowed up. The Lawd had to show His work in miracles 'cause we didn't\nhave learnin' in them days as they has now. And you may not believe it\nbut them things happened. Ah knows a old man what died, and after his\ndeath he would come to our house where he always cut wood, and at night\nwe could hear a chain bein' drug along in the yard, jest as if a big\nlog-chain wuz bein' pulled by somebody. It would drag on up to the\nwoodpile and stop, then we could hear the thump-thump of the ax on the\nwood. The woodpile was near the chimney and it would chop-chop on, then\nstop and we could hear the chain bein' drug back the way it come. This\nwent on fur several nights until my father got tired and one night after\nhe heard it so long, the chop-chop, papa got mad and hollered at the\nhaint, 'G---- D---- you, go to hell!!!' and that spirit went off and\nnever did come back!\n\n\n\"We'd always know somebody wuz goin' to die when we heard a owl come to\na house and start screechin'. We always said, 'somebody is gwine to\ndie!' Honey, you don't hear it now and it's good you don't fur it would\nskeer you to death nearly. It sounded so mo'nful like and we'd put the\npoker or the shovel in the fire and that always run him away; it burned\nhis tongue out and he couldn't holler no more. If they'd let us go out\nlak we always wanted to, Ah don't 'spects we'd a-done it, 'cause we wuz\ntoo skeered. Lawdy, chile, them wuz tryin' days. Ah sho is glad God let\nme live to see these 'uns.\n\n\n\"Ah tried to git the ole-age pension fur Ah sho'ly needed it and wuz\n'titled to it too. Sho wuz. But that visitor jest wouldn't let me go\nthrough. She acted lak that money belonged to her. Ah 'plied when it\nfirst come out and shoulda been one of the first to get one. Ah worried\npowerful much at first fur Ah felt how much better off Ah'd be. Ah\nwouldn't be so dependent lak Ah'm is now. Ah 'spects you know that\n'oman. She is a big black 'oman--wuz named Smith at first befo' she\nmarried. She is a Johns now. She sho is a mean 'oman. She jest wouldn't\ndo no way. Ah even tole her if she let me go through and Ah got my\npension Ah would give her some of the money Ah got, but she jest didn't\ndo no way. She tole me if Ah wuz put on Ah'd get no more than Ah _wuz_\ngittin'. Ah sho believes them thats on gits more'n 75\u00a2 every two weeks.\nAh sho had a hard time and a roughety road to travel with her my\nvisitor until they sent in the housekeeper. Fur that head 'oman jest\nwent rat out and got me some clothes. Everything Ah needed. When Ah tole\nher how my visitor wuz doin' me she jest went out and come rat back with\nall the things Ah needed. Ah don't know why my visitor done me lak that.\nAh said at first it wuz because Ah had this house but honey what could\nAh do with a house when Ah wuz hongry and not able to work. Ah always\nworked hard. 'Course Ah didn't git much fur it but Ah lak to work fur\nwhat Ah gits.\"\n\n\nAunt Sally was beginning to repeat herself and I began to suspect she\nwas talking just to please me. So I arose to go.\n\n\n\"Lawsy mercy, chile, you sho is sweet to set here and talk to a ole\n'oman lak me. Ah sho is glad you come. Ah tole my son you wuz a bundle\nof sunshine and Ah felt so much better the day you left--and heah you is\nagain! Chile, my nose wuzn't itchin' fur nothin'! You come back to see\nme real soon. Ah'se always glad to have you. And the Lawd's gonna sho go\nwith you fur bein' so good to me.\"\n\n\nMy awareness of the obvious fulsomeness in the old woman's praise in no\nway detracted from my feeling of having done a good deed. Aunt Sally was\na clever psychologist and as I carefully picked my way up the weedy path\ntoward the street, I felt indeed that the \"Lawd\" was \"sho goin'\" with\nme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEX-SLAVE INTERVIEW",

        "text": "Seated in a comfortable chair in the living room of her home, Julia\nBunch, Negress of 85 years, presented a picture of the old South that\nwill soon pass away forever. The little 3-room house, approachable only\non foot, was situated on top of a hill. Around the clean-swept yard,\npetunias, verbena, and other flowers were supplemented by a large patch\nof old-fashioned ribbon grass. A little black and white kitten was\nfrisking about and a big red hen lazily scratched under a big shade tree\nin search of food for her brood. Julia's daughter, who was washing\n\"white people's clothes\" around the side of the house, invited us into\nthe living room where her mother was seated.\n\n\nThe floors of the front porch and the living room were scrubbed\nspotlessly clean. There was a rug on the floor, while a piano across one\ncorner, a chifforobe with mirrored doors, a bureau, and several\ncomfortable chairs completed the room's furnishings. A motley assortment\nof pictures adorning the walls included: _The Virgin Mother_, _The\nSacred Bleeding Heart_, several large family photographs, two pictures\nof the Dionne Quintuplets, and one of President Roosevelt.\n\n\nJulia was not very talkative, but had a shy, irresistible chuckle, and\nit was this, together with her personal appearance and the tidiness of\nher home that left an indelible impression on the minds of her visitors.\nHer skin was very dark, and her head closely wrapped in a dark bandana,\nfrom which this gray hair peeped at intervals forming a frame for her\nface. She was clad in a black and white flowered print dress and a dark\ngray sweater, from which a white ruffle was apparent at the neck. Only\ntwo buttons of the sweater were fastened and it fell away at the waist\ndisplaying her green striped apron. From beneath the long dress, her\nfeet were visible encased in men's black shoes laced with white strings.\nHer ornaments consisted of a ring on her third finger, earrings, and\ntortoise-rimmed glasses which plainly displayed their dime-store origin.\n\n\n\"I b'longed to Marse Jackie Dorn of Edgefield County, I was gived to him\nand his wife when dey was married for a weddin' gift. I nussed deir\nthree chilluns for 'em and slep' on a couch in dier bedroom 'til I was\n12 years old, den 'Mancipation come. I loved 'em so and stayed wid 'em\nfor four years atter freedom and when I left 'em I cried and dem\nchilluns cried.\n\n\n\"Yassir, dey was sho' good white people and very rich. Dere warn't\nnothin' lackin' on dat plantation. De big house was part wood and part\nbrick, and de Niggers lived in one or two room box houses built in rows.\nMarse Jackie runned a big grist mill and done de grindin' for all de\nneighbors 'round 'bout. Three or four Niggers wukked in de mill all de\ntime. Us runned a big farm and dairy too.\n\n\n\"Dere was allus plenty t'eat 'cause Marster had a 2-acre gyarden and a\nbig fruit orchard. Two cooks was in de kitchen all de time. Dey cooked\nin a big fireplace, but us had big ovens to cook de meat, biscuits and\nlightbread in. Us made 'lasses and syrup and put up fruits just lak dey\ndoes now.\n\n\n\"My Ma was head weaver. It tuk two or three days to set up de loom\n'cause dere was so many little bitty threads to be threaded up. Us had\ndyes of evvy color. Yassir, us could make wool cloth too. De sheeps was\nsheered once a year and de wool was manufactured up and us had a loom\nwid wheels to spin it into thread.\n\n\n\"Old Marster never whupped nobody and dere was only one man dat I kin\n'member dat de overseer whupped much and he 'served it 'cause he would\nrun away in spite of evvything. Dey would tie him to a tree way down in\nde orchard and whup him.\"\n\n\nJulia kept repeating and seemed anxious to impress upon the minds of her\nvisitors that her white folks were good and very rich. \"Yassir, my white\nfolks had lots of company and visited a lot. Dey rode saddle horses and\nhad deir own carriages wid a high seat for de driver. Nosir, she didn't\nride wid hoopskirts--you couldn't ride wid dem on.\n\n\n\"Us bought some shoes from de market but dere was a travelin' shoemaker\ndat wukked by days for all de folks. He was a slave and didn't git no\nmoney; it was paid to his Marster. Us had our own blacksmith dat wukked\nall de time.\n\n\n\"De slaves from all de plantations 'round come to our corn shuckin's. Us\nhad 'em down in de orchard. Lots of white folks comed too. Dey kilt hogs\nand us had a big supper and den us danced. Nosir, dere warn't no toddy,\nMarse didn't b'lieve in dat, but dey would beat up apples and us drinked\nde juice. It sho' was sweet too.\n\n\n\"Folks done dey travelin' in stages and hacks in dem days. Each of de\nstages had four hosses to 'em. When de cotton and all de other things\nwas ready to go to market, dey would pack 'em and bring 'em to Augusta\nwid mules and wagons. It would take a week and sometimes longer for de\ntrip, and dey would come back loaded down wid 'visions and clothes, and\ndere was allus a plenty for all de Niggers too.\n\n\n\"De white folks allus helped deir Niggers wid de weddin's and buyed deir\nclothes for 'em. I 'members once a man friend of mine come to ax could\nhe marry one of our gals. Marster axed him a right smart of questions\nand den he told him he could have her, but he mustn't knock or cuff her\n'bout when he didn't want her no more, but to turn her loose.\n\n\n\"Us had a big cemetery on our place and de white folks allus let deir\nNiggers come to de fun'rals. De white folks had deir own sep'rate\nburyin' ground, but all de coffins was home-made. Even de ones for de\nsettlement peoples was made right in our shop. Yassum, dey sung at de\nfun'rals and you wants me to sing. I can't sing, but I'll try a little\nbit.\" Then with a beautiful and peculiar rhythm only attained by the\nsouthern Negro, she chanted:\n\n\n  'Come-ye-dat-love-de-Lord\n   And-let-your-joys-be-known.'\n\n\n\"A rooster crowin' outside your door means company's comin' and a\nsquinch owl means sho' death. Dose are all de signs I kin 'member and I\ndon't 'member nothin' 'bout slavery remedies.\n\n\n\"Yassir, dey useter give us a nickel or 10 cents sometimes so us could\nbuy candy from de store.\" Asked if she remembered patterollers she gave\nher sly chuckle and said: \"I sho' does. One time dey come to our house\nto hunt for some strange Niggers. Dey didn't find 'em but I was so\nskeered I hid de whole time dey was dar. Yassir, de Ku Kluxers raised\ncain 'round dar too.\n\n\n\"I 'members de day well when Marster told us us was free. I was glad and\ndidn't know what I was glad 'bout. Den 'bout 200 Yankee soldiers come\nand dey played music right dar by de roadside. Dat was de fust drum and\nfife music I ever heared. Lots of de Niggers followed 'em on off wid\njust what dey had on. None of our Niggers went and lots of 'em stayed\nright on atter freedom.\n\n\n\"Four years atter dat, I left Edgefield and come here wid my old man. Us\nhad six chilluns. My old man died six years ago right dar 'cross de road\nand I'se livin' here wid my daughter. I can't wuk no more. I tried to\nhoe a little out dar in de field last year and I fell down and I hasn't\ntried no more since.\n\n\n\"I went once not so long ago to see my white folkses. Dey gived me a\ndollar to spend for myself and I went 'cross de street and buyed me some\nsnuff--de fust I had had for a long time. Dey wanted to know if I had\never got de old age pension and said dat if I had been close to dem I\nwould have had it 'fore now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HW: Ex.

Jaffee\n\n\n[HW: (This copy has photog. attached.)]\n\n\n\n\nSlavery Days And After\n\n\nI'se Marshal Butler, [HW: 88] years old and was born on December 25. I\nknows it was Christmas Day for I was a gift to my folks. Anyhow, I'se\nthe only niggah that knows exactly how old he be. I disremembers the\nyear but you white folks can figure et out.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nMy mammy was Harriet Butler and my pappy was John Butler and we all was\nraised in Washington-Wilkes.\n\n\nMammy was a Frank Collar niggah and her man was of the tribe of Ben\nButler, some miles down de road. Et was one of dem trial\nmarriages--they'se tried so hard to see each other but old Ben Butler\nsays two passes a week war enuff to see my mammy on de Collar\nplantation. When de war was completed pappy came home to us. We wuz a\nfamily of ten--four females called Sally, Liza, Ellen and Lottie and six\nstrong bucks called Charlie, Elisha, Marshal, Jack, Heywood and little\nJohnnie, [TR: 'cuz he war' marked out] de baby.\n\n\nDe Collar plantation wuz big and I don't know de size of it. Et must\nhave been big for dere war [HW: 250] niggahs aching to go to work--I\nguess they mus' have been aching after de work wuz done. Marse Frank\nbossed the place hisself--dere war no overseers. We raised cotton,\ncorn, wheat and everything we un's et. Dere war no market to bring de\ngoods to. Marse Frank wuz like a foodal lord of back history as my good\nfor nothing grandson would say--he is the one with book-larning from\nAtlanta. Waste of time filling up a nigger's head with dat trash--what\nthat boy needs is muscle-ology--jes' look at my head and hands.\n\n\nMy mammy was maid in de Collar's home and she had many fine\ndresses--some of them were give to her by her missus. Pappy war a field\nnigger for ole Ben Butler and I worked in the field when I wuz knee high\nto a grasshopper. We uns et our breakfast while et war dark and we\ntrooped to the fields at sun-up, carrying our lunch wid us. Nothing\nfancy but jes' good rib-sticking victuals. We come in from the fields at\nsun-down and dere were a good meal awaiting us in de slave quarters. My\ngood Master give out rations every second Monday and all day Monday wuz\ntaken to separate the wheat from the chaff--that is--I mean the victuals\nhad to be organized to be marched off to de proper depository.\n\n\nBefore we uns et we took care of our mules. I had a mule named George--I\nknow my mule--he was a good mule.\n\n\n  \"Yes, I hollow at the mule, and the\n   mule would not gee, this mornin'.\n   Yes, I hollow at the mule, and the\n   mule would not gee.\n   An' I hit him across the head with\n   the single-tree, so soon.\"\n\n\nYes, Boss-man I remembers my mule.\n\n\nMarse Frank gave mammy four acres of ground to till for herself and us\nchildrens. We raised cotton--yes-sah! one bale of it and lots of garden\ntruck. Our boss-man give us Saturday as a holiday to work our four\nacres.\n\n\nAll the niggers worked hard--de cotton pickers had to pick 200 pounds of\ncotton a day and if a nigger didn't, Marse Frank would take de nigger to\nthe barn and beat him with a switch. He would tell de nigger to hollow\nloud as he could and de nigger would do so. Then the old Mistress would\ncome in and say! \"What are you doing Frank?\" \"Beating a nigger\" would be\nhis answer. \"You let him alone, he is my nigger\" and both Marse Frank\nand de whipped nigger would come out of the barn. We all loved Marse and\nthe Mistress. No, we wuz never whipped for stealing--we never stole\nanything in dose days--much.\n\n\nWe sure froliked Saturday nights. Dat wuz our day to howl and we howled.\nOur gals sure could dance and when we wuz thirsty we had lemonade and\nwhiskey. No sah! we never mixed [HW: no] whiskey with [HW: no]\nwater.--Dem dat wanted lemonade got it--de gals all liked it. Niggers\nnever got drunk those days--we wuz scared of the \"Paddle-Rollers.\"\nUm-m-h and swell music. A fiddle and a tin can and one nigger would beat\nhis hand on the can and another nigger would beat the strings on the\n[HW: fiddle] [TR: 'can' marked out.] with broom straws. It wuz almos'\nlike a banjo. I remembers we sung \"Little Liza Jane\" and \"Green Grows\nthe Willow Tree\". De frolik broke up in de morning--about two\no'clock--and we all scattered to which ever way we wuz going.\n\n\nWe put on clean clothes on Sunday and go to church. We went to de white\nchurch. Us niggars sat on one side and de white folks sat on the other.\nWe wuz baptized in de church--de \"pool-room\" wuz right in de church.\n\n\nIf we went visiting we had to have a pass. If nigger went out without a\npass de \"Paddle-Rollers\" would get him. De white folks were the\n\"Paddle-Rollers\" and had masks on their faces. They looked like niggers\nwid de devil in dere eyes. They used no paddles--nothing but straps--wid\nde belt buckle fastened on.\n\n\nYes sah! I got paddled. Et happened dis way. I'se left home one Thursday\nto see a gal on the Palmer plantation--five miles away. Some gal! No, I\ndidn't get a pass--de boss was so busy! Everything was fine until my\nreturn trip. I wuz two miles out an' three miles to go. There come de\n\"Paddle-Rollers\" I wuz not scared--only I couldn't move. They give me\nthirty licks--I ran the rest of the way home. There was belt buckles all\nover me. I ate my victuals off de porch railing. Some gal! Um-m-h. Was\nworth that paddlin' to see that gal--would do it over again to see Mary\nde next night.\n\n\n  \"O Jane! love me lak you useter,\n   O Jane! chew me lak you useter,\n   Ev'y time I figger, my heart gits bigger,\n   Sorry, sorry, can't be yo' piper any mo\".\n\n\nUm-m-mh--Some gal!\n\n\nWe Niggers were a healthy lot. If we wuz really sick Marse Frank would\nsend for Doctor Fielding Ficklin of Washington. If jus' a small cold de\nnigger would go to de woods and git catnip and roots and sich things. If\ntummy ache--dere was de Castor oil--de white folks say children cry for\nit--I done my cryin' afterwards. For sore throat dere was alum.\nEverybody made their own soap--if hand was burned would use soap as a\npoultice and place it on hand. Soap was made out of grease, potash and\nwater and boiled in a big iron pot. If yo' cut your finger use kerozene\nwid a rag around it. Turpentine was for sprains and bad cuts. For\nconstipation use tea made from sheep droppings and if away from home de\nspeed of de feet do not match de speed of this remedy.\n\n\nNo, boss, I'se not superstitious and I'se believe in no signs. I jes'\ncarry a rabbits' foot for luck. But I do believe the screeching of an\nowl is a sign of death. I found et to be true. I had an Uncle named\nHaywood. He stayed at my house and was sick for a month but wasn't so\nbad off. One night uncle had a relapse and dat same night a screech owl\ncome along and sat on de top of de house and he--I mean the\nowl,--\"whooed\" three times and next morning uncle got \"worser\" and at\neleven o'clock he died.\n\n\nI does believe in signs. When de rooster crows in the house it is sign\nof a stranger coming. If foot itches you is going to walk on strange\nland. If cow lows at house at night death will be 'round de house in\nshort time. If sweeping out ashes at night dat is bad luck for you is\nsweeping out your best friend. Remember, your closest friend is your\nworst enemy.\n\n\nIf you want to go a courtin'--et would take a week or so to get your\ngal. Sometimes some fool nigger would bring a gal a present--like\n\"pulled-candy\" and sich like. I had no time for sich foolishness. You\nwould pop the question to boss man to see if he was willing for you to\nmarry de gal. There was no minister or boss man to marry you--no\nlimitations at all. Boss man would jes say: \"Don't forget to bring me a\nlittle one or two for next year\" De Boss man would fix a cottage for two\nand dere you was established for life.\n\n\n  \"If you want to go a courtin', I sho' you where to go,\n   Right down yonder in de house below,\n   Clothes all dirty an' ain't got no broom,\n   Ole dirty clothes all hangin' in de room.\n   Ask'd me to table, thought I'd take a seat,\n   First thing I saw was big chunk o'meat.\n   Big as my head, hard as a maul,\n   ash-cake, corn bread, bran an' all.\"\n\n\nMarse Frank had plenty of visitors to see him and his three gals was\nexcuse for anyone for miles around to come trompin' in. He enterained\nmostly on Tuesday and Thursday nights. I remembers them nights for what\nwas left over from de feasts the niggers would eat.\n\n\nDr. Fielding Ficklen [TR: earlier, 'Ficklin'], Bill Pope, Judge\nReese,--General Robert Toombs and Alexander Stephens from\nCrawfordville--all would come to Marse Franks' big house.\n\n\nGeneral Robert Toombs lived in Washington and had a big plantation 'bout\na mile from de city. He was a farmer and very rich. De General wuz a big\nman--'bout six feet tall--heavy and had a full face. Always had\nunlighted cigar in his mouth. He was the first man I saw who smoked ten\ncent cigars. Niggers used to run to get \"the stumps\" and the lucky\nnigger who got the \"stump\" could even sell it for a dime to the other\nniggers for after all--wasn't it General Toombs' cigar? The General\nnever wore expensive clothes and always carried a crooked-handled\nwalking stick. I'se never heard him say \"niggah\", never heard him cuss.\nHe always helped us niggars--gave gave us nickles and dimes at times.\n\n\nAlexander Stephens wuz crippled. He was a little fellow--slim, dark hair\nand blue eyes. Always used a rolling chair. Marse Frank would see him at\nleast once a month.\n\n\nI'se saw a red cloud in de west in 1860. I knew war was brewing. Marse\nFrank went to war. My uncle was his man and went to war with him--Uncle\nbrought him back after the battle at Gettsburg--wounded. He died later.\nWe all loved him. My mistress and her boys ran de plantation.\n\n\nThe blue-coats came to our place in '62 and 63. They took everythin'\nthat was not red-hot or nailed down. The war made no changes--we did the\nsame work and had plenty to eat. The war was now over. We didn't know we\nwuz free until a year later. I'se stayed on with Marse Frank's boys for\ntwenty years. I'se did the same work fo $35 to $40 a year with rations\nthrown in.\n\n\nI lived so long because I tells no lies, I never spent more than fifty\ncents for a doctor in my life. I believe in whiskey and that kept me\ngoing. And let me tell you--I'se always going to be a nigger till I die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HW: Dist. 5\nEx. Slave #13]\n\n\nAN INTERVIEW ON SLAVERY OBTAINED FROM\nMRS. SARAH BYRD--EX-SLAVE\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Sarah Byrd claims to be 95 years of age but the first impression\none receives when looking at her is that of an old lady who is very\nactive and possessing a sweet clear voice. When she speaks you can\neasily understand every word and besides this, each thought is well\nexpressed. Often during the interview she would suddenly break out in a\nmerry laugh as if her own thoughts amused her.\n\n\nMrs. Sarah Byrd was born in Orange County Virginia the youngest of three\nchildren. During the early part of her childhood her family lived in\nVirginia her mother Judy Newman and father Sam Goodan each belonging to\na different master. Later on the family became separated the father was\nsold to a family in East Tennessee and the mother and children were\nbought by Doctor Byrd in Augusta, Georgia. Here Mrs. Byrd remarked\n\"Chile in them days so many families were broke up and some went one way\nand der others went t'other way; and you nebber seed them no more.\nVirginia wuz a reg'lar slave market.\"\n\n\nDr. Byrd owned a large plantation and raised such products as peas\npotatoes, cotton corn (etc). There were a large number of slaves. Mrs.\nByrd was unable to give the exact number but remarked. \"Oh Lordy Chile I\nnebber could tell just how many slaves that man had t'wuz too many uv\nem.\"\n\n\nThe size of the plantation required that the slaves be classified\naccording to the kind of work each was supposed to do. There were the\n\"cotton pickers\", the \"plow hands,\" the \"hoe hands,\" the \"rail\nsplitters,\" etc. \"My very fust job,\" remarked Mrs. Byrd, \"wuz that uv\ncotton picking.\" Mrs Byrd's mother was a full [TR: field?] hand.\n\n\nHouses on the Byrd Plantation were made of logs and the cracks were\ndaubed with mud. The chimnies were made of mud and supported by sticks.\n\n\nEach fireplace varied in length from 3 to 4 feet because they serve the\npurpose of stoves; and the family meals were prepared in those large\nfireplaces often two and three pots were suspended from a rod running\nacross the fireplace. Most of the log houses consisted of one room;\nhowever if the family was very large two rooms were built. The\nfurnishings consisted only of a home-made table, benches, and a\nhome-made bed, the mattress of which was formed by running ropes from\nside to side forming a framework. Mattresses were made by filling a tick\nwith wheatstraw. The straw was changed each season. Laughing Mrs. Byrd\nremarked, \"Yessirree, them houses wuz warmer than some are ter day.\"\n\n\nDoctor Byrd was rather kind and tried to help his slaves as much as\npossible, but according to Mrs. Byrd his wife was very mean and often\npunished her slaves without any cause. She never gave them anything but\nthe coarsest foods. Although there of plenty of milk and butter, she\nonly gave it to the families after it had soured. \"Many a day I have\nseed butter just sittin around in pans day after day till it got good\nand spoiled then she would call some uv us and give it ter us. Oh she\nwuz a mean un,\" remarked Mrs. Byrd. Continuing Mrs. Byrd remarked \"she\nwould give us bread that had been cooked a week.\" Mr. Byrd gave his\nslave families good clothes. Twice a year clothing was distributed among\nhis families. Every June summer clothes were given and every October\nwinter clothes were given. Here Mrs. Byrd remarked \"I nebber knowed what\nit wuz not ter have a good pair uv shoes.\" Cloth for the dresses and\nshirts was spun on the plantation by the slaves.\n\n\nThe treatment of the slaves is told in Mrs. Byrd's own words:\n\n\n\"We wuz always treated nice by Master Byrd and he always tried ter save\nus punishment at the hands uv his wife but that 'oman wuz somethin'\nnother. I nebber will ferget once she sent me after some brush broom and\ntold me ter hurry back. Well plums wuz jest gitting ripe so I just took\nmy time and et all the plums I wanted after that I come on back ter the\nhouse. When I got there she called me upstairs, 'Sarah come here.' Up\nthe steps I went and thar she stood with that old cow hide. She struck\nme three licks and I lost my balance and tumbled backward down the\nstairs. I don't know how come I didn't hurt myself but the Lord wuz wid\nme and I got up and flew. I could hear her just hollering 'Come back\nhere! come back here!' but I ant stop fer nothing. That night at supper\nwhile I wuz fanning the flies from the table she sed ter the doctor.\n'Doctor what you think? I had ter whip that little devil ter day. I sent\nher after brush broom and she went off and eat plums instead of hurrying\nback.' The doctor just looked at her and rolled his eyes but never sed a\nword. There wuz very little whipping on Byrd's plantation, but I have\ngone ter bed many a night and heard 'em gittin whipped on the plantation\nnext ter us. If dey runned away they would put the hounds on 'em.\"\nConcluding her story on treatmeant Mrs. Byrd remarked \"Yessirree I could\ntell that 'oman wuz mean the first time I seed her after we came from\nVirginia cause she had red eyes.\" \"Pader rollers\" stayed busy all the\ntime trying to find slaves off their plantations without passes.\nMarriages were performed by having the couple jump the broom. If the\n[TR: 'couple' deleted, handwritten words above illegible] belonged to\ndifferent masters oftentimes one master would purchase the other; but\nshould neither wish to sell the man would then have to get passes to\nvisit his wife on her plantation. \"Dey would leave the plantation on\nSaturday afternoons and on Sunday afternoon you could see 'em coming in\njust lak they wuz coming from church,\" remarked Mrs. Byrd.\n\n\nThere were frolics on the Byrd plantation any time that the slaves chose\nto have them. \"Yes sir we could frolic all we want ter. I use ter be so\nglad when Saturday night came cause I knowed us wuz go have a frolic and\nI wouldn't have a bit 'uv appetite I would tell my ma we gwine dance ter\nnight I dont want nothin teet. Yes sir us would frolic all night long\nsometimes when the sun rise on Sunday morning us would all be layin\nround or settin on the floor. They made music on the banjo, by knocking\nbones, and blowing quills.\"\n\n\nThe Byrds did not provide a church on their plantation for their slaves\nneither were they allowed to attend the white church; instead they had\nprayer meetings in their own cabins where they could sing pray and shout\nas much as they wished. \"I nebber will fergit the last prayer meeting us\nhad,\" remarked Mrs. Byrd. \"Two woman named Ant Patsy and Ant Prudence\ncame over from the next plantation. I believed they slipped over there\nwid out gittin a pass. Anyway, they old master came there and whipped\n'em and made 'em go home. I reckin he thought us wuz praying ter git\nfree.\" Continuing--\n\n\nI nebber will fergit the fust time I set eyes on them thar Yankees. I\ndone already heard 'bout how they wuz going round ter the different\nplantations taking the horses and carrying away the money and other\nvaluable things, but they had nebber come ter our place. So this day I\nsaw 'em coming cross the railroad track and they look jest lack thunder\nthere wuz so meny 'uv em. When they got ter our house every body wuz\nsleep and they knocked and knocked. We had a bad dog that didn't take no\nfoolishness off nobody, so when he kept barking them Yankees cursed him\nand do you know he heshed up? I sid, 'Dear Lord what sort of man is that\nall he got ter do is curse that dog and he don't even growl.' Well, when\nthey finally got in all they wanted wuz ter know if Mr. Byrd could help\nfeed the soldiers until Monday. Mr. Byrd told 'em he would. Soon after\nthat the war ended and we wuz called ter gether and told us wuz free.\nSome uv'em stayed there and some uv'em left. Us left and moved ter\nanother plantation.\"\n\n\nMrs. Byrd who had previously given the writer an interview on folk-lore\nasked the writer to return at a later date and she would try to think up\nmore information concerning superstitions, conjure, etc. The writer\nthanked her for the interview and promised to make another visit soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx-Slave #18\n\n\nINTERVIEW WITH (MRS.) MARIAH CALLAWAY EX-SLAVE\n\n\n[TR: A significant portion of this interview was repeated in typescript;\nwhere there was a discrepancy, the clearer version was used. Where a\ncompletely different word was substituted, 'the original' refers to the\ntypewritten page.]\n\n\n\n\nMrs. Mariah Callaway sat in a chair opposite the writer and told her\nfreely of the incidents of slavery as she remembered them. To a casual\nobserver it will come as a surprise to know the woman was blind. She is\nquite old, but her thoughts were clearly and intelligently related to\nthe writer.\n\n\nMrs. Callaway was born in Washington, Wilkes County, Georgia probably\nduring the year 1852, as she estimated her age to be around 12 or 13\nyears when freedom was declared. She does not remember her mother and\nfather, as her mother died the second day after she was born, so the job\nof rearing her and a small brother fell on her grandmother, Mariah\nWillis, for whom she was named. Mrs. Callaway stated that the old\nmaster, Jim Willis, kept every Negro's age in a Bible: but after he died\nthe Bible was placed upstairs in the gallery and most of the pages were\ndestroyed. The following is a story of the purchase of Mrs. Callaway's\ngrandfather as related by her.\n\n\n\"My grandfather come directly from Africa and I never shall forget the\nstory he told us of how he and other natives were fooled on board a ship\nby the white slave traders using red handkerchiefs as enticement. When\nthey reached America, droves of them were put on the block and sold to\npeople all over the United States.\n\n\nThe master and mistress of their plantation were Mr. Jim Willis and Mrs.\nNancy Willis who owned hundreds of acres of land and a large number of\nslaves. Mrs. Callaway was unable to give an exact number but stated the\nWillises were considered wealthy people. On their plantation were raised\nsheep, goats, mules, horses, cows, etc. Cotton, corn and vegetables were\nalso raised. The Willis family was a large one consisting of six\nchildren. 4 boys and 2 girls. Their home was a large two-story frame\nhouse which was set apart from the slave quarters.\n\n\nSlave homes on the Willis plantation differed in no respect from the\nusual type found elsewhere. All homes were simple log cabins grouped\ntogether, forming what is known as slave quarters.\n\n\nThe Willis family as kind and religious and saw to it that their slaves\nwere given plenty of food to eat. Every Monday night each family was\ngiven its share of food for the week. Each grown person was given a peck\nof corn [TR: meal on original page] and three pounds of meat; besides\nthe vegetables, etc. On Tuesday morning each family was given an ample\namount of real flour for biscuits.\n\n\nMany of the slave families, especially Mrs. Callaway's family, were\ngiven the privilege of earning money by selling different products. \"My\ngrandfather owned a cotton patch,\" remarked Mrs. Callaway, \"and the\nmaster would loan him a mule so he could plow it at night. Two boys\nwould each hold a light for him to work by. He preferred working at\nnight to working on his holidays. My master had a friend in Augusta,\nGa., by the name of Steve Heard and just before my grandfather got ready\nto sell his cotton, the master would write Mr. Heard and tell him that\nhe was sending cotton by Sam and wanted his sold and a receipt returned\nto him. He also advised him to give all the money received to Sam. When\ngrandfather returned he would be loaded down with sugar, cheese, tea,\nmackerel, etc. for his family.\"\n\n\nWhen the women came home from the fields they had to spin 7 cuts, so\nmany before supper and so many after supper. A group of women were then\nselected to weave the cuts of thread into cloth. Dyes were made from red\nshoe berries and later used to dye this cloth different colors. All\nslaves received clothing twice a year, spring and winter. Mr. Jim Willis\nwas known for his kindness to his slaves and saw to it that they were\nkept supplied with Sunday clothes and shoes as well as work clothing. A\ncolored shoemaker was required to keep the plantation supplied with\nshoes; and everyone was given a pair of Sunday shoes which they kept\nshined with a mixture of egg white and soot.\n\n\nThe size of the Willis Plantation and the various crops and cattle\nraised required many different types of work. There were the plow hands,\nthe hoe hands, etc. Each worker had a required amount of work to\ncomplete each day and an overseer was hired by slave owners to keep\ncheck on this phase of the work. \"We often waited until the overseer got\nbehind a hill, and then we would lay down our hoe and call on God to\nfree us, my grandfather told me,\" remarked Mrs. Callaway. \"However, I\nwas a pet in the Willis household and did not have any work to do except\nplay with the small children. I was required to keep their hands and\nfaces clean. Sometimes I brought in chips to make the fires. We often\nkept so much noise playing in the upstairs bedroom that the master would\ncall to us and ask that we keep quiet.\" Older women on the plantation\nacted as nurses for all the small children and babies while their\nparents worked in the fields. The mistress would keep a sharp eye on the\nchildren also to see that they were well cared for. A slave's life was\nvery valuable to their owners.\n\n\nPunishment was seldom necessary on the Willis plantation as the master\nand mistress did everything possible to make their slaves happy; and to\na certain extent indulged them. They were given whisky liberally from\ntheir master's still; and other choice food on special occasions. \"I\nremember once,\" remarked Mrs. Callaway, \"my aunt Rachel burned the\nbiscuits and the young master said to her, \"Rachel, you nursed me and I\npromised not to ever whip you, so don't worry about burning the bread.\"\nMy mistress was very fond of me, too, and gave me some of everything\nthat she gave her own children, tea cakes, apples, etc. She often told\nme that she was my mother and was supposed to look after me. In spite of\nthe kindness of the Willis family there were some slaves who were\nunruly; so the master built a house off to itself and called it the\nWillis jail. Here he would keep those whom he had to punish. I have\nknown some slaves to run away on other plantations and the hounds would\nbite plugs out of their legs.\"\n\n\nThe Willis family did not object to girls and boys courting. There were\nlarge trees, and often in the evenings the boys from other plantations\nwould come over to see the girls on the Willis plantation. They would\nstand in groups around the trees, laughing and talking. If the courtship\nreached the point of marriage a real marriage ceremony was performed\nfrom the Bible and the man was given a pass to visit his wife weekly.\nFollowing a marriage a frolic took place and the mistress saw to it that\neveryone was served nice foods for the occasion.\n\n\nFrolics were common occurrences on the Willis plantation, also quilting\nparties. Good foods consisting of pies, cakes, chicken, brandied\npeaches, etc. \"Dancing was always to be expected by anyone attending\nthem,\" remarked Mrs. Callaway. \"Our master always kept two to three\nhundred gallons of whisky and didn't mind his slaves drinking. I can\nremember my master taking his sweetened dram every morning, and often he\ngave me some in a tumbler. On Christmas Day big dinners were given for\nall of the slaves and a few ate from the family's table after they had\nfinished their dinner.\"\n\n\nMedical care was promptly given a slave when he became ill. Special care\nwas always given them for the Willis family had a personal interest in\ntheir slaves. \"On one occasion,\" remarked Mrs. Calloway, \"the scarlet\nfever broke out among the slaves and to protect the well ones it became\nnecessary to build houses in a field for those who were sick. This\nlittle settlement later became know as \"Shant Field.\" Food was carried\nto a hill and left so that the sick persons could get it without coming\nin contact with the others. To kill the fever, sticks of fat pine were\ndipped in tar and set on fire and then placed all over the field.\"\n\n\nReligion played as important part in the lives of the slaves, and such\n[TR: much?] importance was attached to their prayer meetings. There were\nno churches, provided and occasionally they attended the white churches;\nbut more often they held their prayer meetings in their own cabins.\nPrayers and singing was in a moaning fashion, and you often heard this\nand nothing more. On Sunday afternoons everyone found a seat around the\nmulberry tree and the young mistress would conduct Sunday School.\n\n\nConcerning the Civil War, Mrs. Callaway related the following story:\n\n\n\"When the war broke out my mistress' home became a sewing center and\ndeifferent women in the neighborhood would come there every day to make\nclothes for the soldiers. On each bed was placed the vests, coats,\nshirts, pants, and caps. One group did all the cutting, one the\nstitching, and one the fitting. Many women cried while they served [TR:\nsewed?] heart-broken because their husbands and sons had to go to the\nwar. One day the Yanks came to our plantation and took all of the best\nhorses. In one of their wagons were bales of money which they had taken.\nMoney then was blue in color; of course, there was silver and gold.\nAfter taking the horses they drank as much whisky as they could hold and\nthen filled their canteens. The rest of the whisky they filled with\nspit. The master didn't interfere for fear of the long guns which they\ncarried.\"\n\n\nAfter the war some of the slaves left the plantation to seek their\nfortune; others remained, renting land from the Willis family or working\nwith them on a share crop basis.\n\n\nAs a conclusion Mrs. Callaway remarked: \"My folks were good and I know\n[HW: they're] in heaven.\" Mrs. Callaway is deeply religious and all\nduring the interview would constantly drift to the subject of religion.\nShe is well cared for by her nine children, six girls and three boys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANTATION LIFE AS VIEWED BY EX-SLAVE",

When asked if she would like to talk about the\nold plantation days, she replied; \"Yes Ma'am, I don't mind tellin' what\nI know, but for dat I done forgot I sho' ain't gwine make nothin' up.\nFor one thing, I ain't never lived on no plantation. I was a house\nservant in town.\" She added: \"Do you mind me axin' you one favor?\"\nConsent was given and she continued: \"Dat is, please don't call me Aunt\nSusan; it makes me feel lak I was a hundred years old.\n\n\n\"I was borned in Clarke County, March 7, 1860; I believes dat's what dey\nsay. Mudder was named Fannie and Pappy's name was Willis. Us chillun\ncalled 'im Pappy lak he was de onliest one in de world. He fust belonged\nto Marse Maxwell of Savannah, Georgia. I was so little I disremembers\nhow Pappy come by de name of Castle. In all de seben of us chillun, I\ndidn't have but one brudder, and his name was Johnny. My five sisters\nwas Mary, Louvenia, Rosa, Fannie, and Sarah. All I 'members 'bout us as\nchilluns was dat us played lak chilluns will do.\n\n\n\"In de quarters us had old timey beds and cheers, but I'll tell you whar\nI slept most times. Hit was on a cot right at de foot of Mist'ess' bed.\nI stayed at de big house most of de time at night, and 'fore bedtime I\nsot close by Mist'ess on a foot stool she had special for me.\n\n\n\"All I ricollects 'bout my gran'ma was she belonged to General Thomas\nR.R. Cobb, and us called 'im Marse Thomas. Gran'ma Susan wouldn't do\nright so Marse Thomas sold her on de block.\n\n\n\"Us had evvything good to eat. Marse Thomas was a rich man and fed 'is\nNiggers well. Dey cooked in a big open fireplace and biled greens and\nsome of de udder vittals in a great big pot what swung on a rack. Meat,\nfish and chickens was fried in a griddle iron what was sot on a flat\ntopped trivet wid slits to let de fire thoo. Dey called it a trivet\n'cause it sot on three legs and hot coals was raked up under it. Hoe\ncakes made out of cornmeal and wheat flour sho' was good cooked on dat\ngriddle. 'Tatoes was roasted in de ashes, and dey cooked bread what dey\ncalled ash cake in de ashes. Pound cake, fruit cake, light bread and\nbiscuits was baked in a great big round pot, only dey warn't as deep as\nde pots dey biled in; dese was called ovens. Makes me hongry to think\n'bout all dem good vittals now.\n\n\n\"Oh! Yes Ma'am, us had plenty 'possums. Pappy used to cotch so many\nsometimes he jest put 'em in a box and let us eat 'em when us got ready.\n'Possums tasted better atter dey was put up in a box and fattened a\nwhile. Us didn't have many rabbits; dey warn't as much in style den as\ndey is now, and de style of eatin' 'possums lak dey done in slav'ry\ntimes, dat is 'bout over. Dey eats 'em some yet, but it ain't stylish no\nmo'. Us chillun used to go fishin' in Moore's Branch; one would stand on\none side of de branch wid a stick, and one on de udder side would roust\nde fishes out. When dey come to de top and jump up, us would hit 'em on\nde head, and de grown folks would cook 'em. Dere warn't but one gyarden,\nbut dat had plenty in it for evvybody.\n\n\n\"In summer time us wore checkedy dresses made wid low waistes and\ngethered skirts, but in winter de dresses was made out of linsey-woolsey\ncloth and underclothes was made out of coarse unbleached cloth.\nPetticoats had bodice tops and de draw's was made wid waistes too. Us\nchillun didn't know when Sunday come. Our clothes warn't no diffu'nt den\nfrom no udder day. Us wore coarse, heavy shoes in winter, but in summer\nus went splatter bar feets.\n\n\n\"Marse Thomas was jest as good as he could be, what us knowed of 'im.\nMiss Marion, my Mist'ess, she won't as good to us as Marse Thomas, but\nshe was all right too. Dey had a heap of chillun. Deir twin boys died,\nand de gals was Miss Callie, Miss Sallie, Miss Marion (dey called her\nMiss Birdie), and Miss Lucy, dat Lucy Cobb Institute was named for. My\nmudder was Miss Lucy's nuss. Marse Thomas had a big fine melonial\n(colonial) house on Prince Avenue wid slave quarters in de back yard of\nhis 10-acre lot. He owned 'most nigh dat whole block 'long dar.\n\n\n\"Oh! dey had 'bout a hundred slaves I'm sho', for dere was a heap of\n'em. De overseer got 'em up 'bout five o'clock in de mornin' and dat\nbreakfust sho' had better be ready by seben or else somebody gwine to\nhave to pay for it. Dey went to deir cabins 'bout ten at night. Marse\nwas good, but he would whup us if we didn't do right. Miss Marion was\nallus findin' fault wid some of us.\n\n\n\"Jesse was de car'iage driver. Car'iages was called phaetons den. Dey\nhad high seats up in front whar de driver sot, and de white folks sot in\nde car'iage below. Jesse went to de War wid Marse Thomas, and was wid\nhim when he was kilt at Fred'ricksburg, Virginia. I heard 'em sey one of\nhis men shot 'im by mistake, but I don't know if dat's de trufe or not.\nI do know dey sho' had a big grand fun'al 'cause he was a big man and a\ngeneral in de War.\n\n\n\"Some of de slaves on Marse Thomas' place knowed how to read. Aunt Vic\nwas one of de readers what read de Bible. But most of de Niggers didn't\nhave sense enough to learn so dey didn't bother wid 'em. Dey had a\nchurch way downtown for de slaves. It was called Landon's Chapel for\nRev. Landon, a white man what preached dar. Us went to Sunday School\ntoo. Aunt Vic read de Bible sometimes den. When us jined de chu'ch dey\nsung: 'Amazing Grace How Sweet de Sound.'\n\n\n\"Marse Thomas had lots of slaves to die, and dey was buried in de\ncolored folks cemetery what was on de river back of de Lucas place. I\nused to know what dey sung at fun'als way back yonder, but I can't bring\nit to mind now.\n\n\n\"No Ma'am, none of Marse Thomas' Niggers ever run away to de Nawth. He\nwas good to his Niggers. Seems lak to me I 'members dem patterollers run\nsome of Marse Thomas' Niggers down and whupped 'em and put 'em in jail.\nOld Marse had to git 'em out when dey didn't show up at roll call next\nmornin'.\n\n\n\"Marse Thomas allus put a man or de overseer on a hoss or a mule when he\nwanted to send news anywhar. He was a big man and had too many slaves to\ndo anything hisse'f.\n\n\n\"I 'spect dey done den lak dey does now, slipped 'round and got in\ndevilment atter de day's wuk was done. Marse Thomas was allus havin'\nswell elegant doin's at de big house. De slaves what was house servants\ndidn't have no time off only atter dinner on Sundays.\n\n\n\"Christmas was somepin' else. Us sho' had a good time den. Dey give de\nchilluns china dolls and dey sont great sacks of apples, oranges, candy,\ncake, and evvything good out to de quarters. At night endurin' Christmas\nus had parties, and dere was allus some Nigger ready to pick de banjo.\nMarse Thomas allus give de slaves a little toddy too, but when dey was\nhavin' deir fun if dey got too loud he sho' would call 'em down. I was\nallus glad to see Christmas come. On New Year's Day, de General had big\ndinners and invited all de high-falutin' rich folks.\n\n\n\"My mudder went to de corn shuckin's off on de plantations, but I was\ntoo little to go. Yes Ma'am, us sho' did dance and sing funny songs way\nback in dem days. Us chillun used to play 'Miss Mary Jane,' and us would\npat our hands and walk on broom grass. I don't know nothin' 'bout\ncharms. Dey used to tell de chillun dat when old folks died dey turned\nto witches. I ain't never seed no ghostes, but I sho' has felt 'em. Dey\nmade de rabbits jump over my grave and had me feelin' right cold and\nclammy. Mudder used to sing to Miss Lucy to git her to sleep, but I\ndon't 'member de songs.\n\n\n\"Marster was mighty good to his slaves when dey got sick. He allus sont\nfor Dr. Crawford Long. He was de doctor for de white folks and Marster\nhad him for de slaves.\n\n\n\"My mudder said she prayed to de Lord not to let Niggers be slaves all\ndeir lifes and sho' 'nough de yankees comed and freed us. Some of de\nslaves shouted and hollered for joy when Miss Marion called us togedder\nand said us was free and warn't slaves no more. Most of 'em went right\nout and left 'er and hired out to make money for deyselfs.\n\n\n\"I stayed on wid my mudder and she stayed on wid Miss Marion. Miss\nMarion give her a home on Hull Street 'cause mudder was allus faithful\nand didn't never leave her. Atter Miss Marion died, mudder wukked for\nMiss Marion's daughter, Miss Callie Hull, in Atlanta. Den Miss Callie\ndied and mudder come on back to Athens. 'Bout ten years ago she died.\n\n\n\"I wukked for Mrs. Burns on Jackson Street a long time, but she warn't\nno rich lady lak de Cobbs. De last fambly I wukked for was Dr. Hill. I\nnussed 'til atter de chillun got too big for dat, and den I done de\nwashin' 'til dis misery got in my limbs.\"\n\n\nWhen asked about marriage customs, she laughed and replied: \"I was\nengaged, but I didn't marry though, 'cause my mudder 'posed me marryin'.\nI had done got my clothes bought and ready. Mrs. Hull helped me fix my\nthings. My dress was a gray silk what had pearl beads on it and was\ntrimmed in purple.\n\n\n\"What does I think 'bout freedom? I think it's best to be free, 'cause\nyou can do pretty well as you please. But in slav'ry time if de Niggers\nhad a-behaved and minded deir Marster and Mist'ess dey wouldn't have had\nsich a hard time. Mr. Jeff Davis 'posed freedom, but Mr. Abraham Lincoln\nfreed us, and he was all right. Booker Washin'ton was a great man, and\ndone all he knowed how to make somepin' out of his race.\n\n\n\"De reason I jined de church was dat de Lord converted me. He is our\nguide. I think people ought to be 'ligious and do good and let deir\nlights shine 'cause dat's de safest way to go to Heben.\"\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the interview Susan asked: \"Is dat all you gwine to\nax me? Well, I sho' enjoyed talkin' to you. I hopes I didn't talk loud\n'nough for dem other Niggers to hear me, 'cause if you open your mouth\ndey sho' gwine tell it. Yes Ma'am, I'se too old to wuk now and I'se\nthankful for de old age pension. If it warn't for dat, since dis misery\ntuk up wid me, I would be done burnt up, I sho' would. Good-bye\nMist'ess.\"",

I had two\nhalf-brothers youngern me, John Henry an Ed, an a half-sister, Elsie. De\nboys had to mind de calves an sheeps, an Elsie nursed de missus' baby. I\ndone de cookin, mosly, an helped my mammy spin.\n\n\n\"I was ony five year old when dey brung me to Sanderson, in Baker\nCounty, Florida. My stepfather went to work for a turpentine man, makin\nbarrels, an he work at dat job till he drop dead in de camp. I reckon he\nmusta had heart disease.\n\n\n\"I doan recleck ever seein my mammy wear shoes. Even in de winter she go\nbarefoot, an I reckon cold didn't hurt her feet no moran her hands an\nface. We all wore dresses made o' homespun. De thread was spun an de\ncloth wove right in our own home. My mamy an granmamy an me done it in\nspare time.\n\n\n\"My weddin dress was blue--blue for true. I thought it was de prettiest\ndress I ever see. We was married in de court-house, an dat be a mighty\nhappy day for me. Mos folks dem days got married by layin a broom on de\nfloor an jumpin over it. Dat seals de marriage, an at de same time\nbrings em good luck.\n\n\n\"Ya see brooms keeps hants away. When mean folks dies, de old debbil\nsometimes doan want em down dere in da bad place, so he makes witches\nout of em, an sends em back. One thing bout witches, dey gotta count\neverthing fore dey can git acrosst it. You put a broom acrosst your door\nat night an old witches gotta count ever straw in dat broom fore she can\ncome in.\n\n\n\"Some folks can jes nachly see hants bettern others. Teeny, my gal can.\nI reckon das cause she been borned wid a veil--you know, a caul, sumpum\nwhat be over some babies' faces when dey is borned. Folks borned wid a\ncaul can see sperrits, an tell whas gonna happen fore it comes true.\n\n\n\"Use to worry Teeny right smart, seein sperrits day an night. My husban\nsay he gonna cure her, so he taken a grain o' corn an put it in a bottle\nin Teeny's bedroom over night. Den he planted it in de yard, an driv\nplenty sticks roun da place. When it was growin good, he put leaf-mold\nroun de stalk, an watch it ever day, an tell us don't _nobody_ touch de\nstalk. It raise three big ears o' corn, an when dey was good roastin\nsize he pick em off an cook em an tell Teeny eat ever grain offn all\nthree cobs. He watch her while she done it, an she ain never been\nworried wid hants no more. She sees em jes the same, but dey doan bother\nher none.\n\n\n\"Fust time I ever knowed a hant to come into our quarters was when I was\njes big nough to go out to parties. De game what we use to play was spin\nde plate. Ever time I think on dat game it gives me de shivers. One time\nthere was a strange young man come to a party where I was. Said he name\nRichard Green, an he been takin keer o' horses for a rich man what was\ngonna buy a plantation in dat county. He look kinda slick an\ndressed-up--diffunt from de rest. All de gals begin to cast sheep's eyes\nat him, an hope he gonna choose dem when day start playin games.\n\n\n\"Pretty soon dey begin to play spin de plate an it come my turn fust\nthing. I spin it an call out 'Mister Green!' He jumps to de middle o' de\nring to grab de plate an 'Bang'--bout four guns go off all at oncet, an\nMister Green fall to de floor plum dead shot through de head.\n\n\n\"Fore we knowed who done it, de sheriff an some more men jump down from\nde loft, where dey bean hidin an tell us quit hollerin an doan be\nscairt. Dis man be a bad deeper--you know, one o' them outlaws what\nkills folks. He some kinda foreigner, an jes tryin make blieve he a\nniggah, so's they don't find him.\n\n\n\"Wall we didn't feel like playin no more games, an f'ever after dat you\ncoundn't git no niggahs to pass dat house alone atter dark. Dey say da\nplace was hanted, an if you look through de winder any dark night you\ncould see a man in dere spinnin de plate.\n\n\n\"I sho didn't never look in, cause I done seen more hants aready dan I\never wants to see agin. One night I was goin to my granny's house. It\nwas jes comin dark, an when I got to de crick an start across on de\nfoot-log, dere on de other end o' dat log was a man wid his haid cut off\nan layin plum over on his shoulder. He look at me, kinda pitiful, an\ndon't say a word--but I closely never waited to see what he gonna talk\nabout. I pure flew back home. I was so scairt I couldn't tell de folks\nwhat done happened till I set down an get my breath.\n\n\n\"Nother time, not so long ago, when I live down in Gary, I be walkin\ndown de railroad track soon in de mornin an fore I knowed it, dere was a\nwhite man walkin long side o' me. I jes thought it were somebody, but I\nwadn't sho, so I turn off at de fust street to git way from dere. De nex\nmawnin I be boin[TR: goin?] to work at de same time. It were kinda foggy\nan dark, so I never seen nobody till I mighty nigh run into dis same\nman, an dere he goes, bout half a step ahead o' me, his two hands restin\non his be-hind.\n\n\n\"I was so close up to him I could see him plain as I see you. He had\nfingernails dat long, all cleaned an polished. He was tull, an had on a\nderby hat, an stylish black clothes. When I walk slow he slow down, an\nwhen I stop, he stop, never oncet lookin roun. My feets make a noise on\nde cinders tween de rails, but he doan make a mite o' noise. Dat was de\nfust thing got me scairt, but I figger I better find out for sho ifen he\nbe a sperrit; so I say, gook an loud: 'Lookee here, Mister, I jez an old\ncolored woman, an I knows my place, an I wisht you wouldn't walk wid me\ncounta what folks might say.'\n\n\n\"He never looked roun no moren if I wan't there, an I cut my eyes roun\nto see if there is somebody I can holler to for help. When I looked back\nhe was gone; gone, like dat, without makin a sound. Den I knowed he be a\nhant, an de nex day when I tell somebody bout it dey say he be de genman\nwhat got killed at de crossin a spell back, an other folks has seen him\njus like I did. Dey say dey can hear babies cryin at de trestle right\nnear dere, an ain't nobody yit ever found em.\n\n\n\"Dat ain de ony hant I ever seen. One day I go out to de smokehouse to\ngit a mess o' taters. It was after sundown, but still purty light. When\nI gits dere de door be unlocked an a big man standin half inside. 'What\nyou doin stealin our taters!' I hollers at him, an pow! He gone, jes\nlike dat. Did I git back to dat house! We mighty glad to eat grits an\ncornbread dat night.\n\n\n\"When we livin at Titusville, I see my old mammy comin up de road jus as\nplain as day. I stan on de porch, fixin to run an meet her, when all of\na sudden she be gone. I begin to cry an tell de folks I ain't gonna see\nmy mammy agin. An sho nuff, I never did. She die at Sanderson, back in\nWest Florida, fore I got to see her.\n\n\n\"Does I blieve in witches? S-a-a-y, I knows more bout em den to jes\n'blieve'--I been _rid_ by em. Right here in dis house. You ain never\nbeen rid by a witch? Well, you mighty lucky. Dey come in de night,\nginnerly soon after you drop off to sleep. Dey put a bridle on your\nhead, an a bit in your mouth, an a saddle on your back. Den dey take off\ntheir skin an hang it up on de wall. Den dey git on you an some nights\ndey like to ride you to death. You try to holler but you kaint, counta\nthe iron bit in your mouth, an you feel like somebody holdin you down.\nDen dey ride you back home an into your bed. When you hit de bed you\njump an grab de kivers, an de witch be gone, like dat. But you know you\nbeen rid mighty hard, cause you all wet wid sweat, an you feel plum\ntired out.\n\n\n\"Some folks say you jus been dreamin, counta de blood stop circulatin in\nyaur back. Shucks! Dey ain never been rid by a witch, or dey ain sayin\ndat.\n\n\n\"Old witch docter, he want ten dollers for a piece of string, what he\nsay some kinda charm words over. Tells me to make a image o' dat old\nwitch outa dough, an tie dat string roun its neck; den when I bake it in\nde oven, it swell up an de magic string shet off her breath. I didn't\nhave no ten dollar, so he say ifen I git up five dollar he make me a\nhand--you know, what collored folks cals a jack. Dat be a charm what\nwill keep de witches away. I knows how to make em, but day doan do no\ngood thout de magic words, an I doan know dem. You take a little pinch\no' dried snake skin an some graveyard dirt, an some red pepper an a\nlock o' your hair wrapped roun some black rooster feathers. Den you spit\nwhiskey on em an wrap em in red flannel an sew if into a ball bout dat\nbig. Den you hang it under your right armpit, an ever week you give it a\ndrink o' whiskey, to keep it strong an powful.\n\n\n\"Dat keep de witches fum ridin you; but nary one o' dese charms work wid\ndis old witch. I got a purty good idee who she is, an she got a charm\npowfuller dan both of dem. But she kaint git acrosst flaxseed, not till\nshe count ever seed. You doan blieve dat? Huh! I reckon I knows--I done\ntried it out. I gits me a lil bag o' pure fresh flaxseed, an I sprinkle\nit all roun de bed; den I put some on top of da mattress, an under de\nsheet. Den I goes to bed an sleeps like a baby, an dat old witch doan\nbother me no more.\n\n\n\"Ony oncet. Soon's I wake up, I light me a lamp an look on de floor an\ndere, side o' my bed was my dress, layin right over dat flaxseed, so's\nshe could walk over on de dress, big as life. I snatch up de dress an\nthrow it an de bed; den I go to sleep, an I ain _never_ been bothered no\nmore.\n\n\n\"Some folks reads de Bible backwards to keep witches fum ridin em, but\ndat doan do me no good, cause I kaint read. But flaxseed work so good I\ndoan be studyin night-ridin witches no more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\n\n\nRachel A.

        "age": "30",
        "address": "Florida",
        "state": "Florida",
        "text": "For almost 30 years Edward Waters College, an African Methodist\nEpiscopal School, located on the north side of Kings Road in the western\nsection of Jacksonville, has employed as watchman, Samuel Simeon Andrews\n(affectionately called \"Parson\"), a former slave of A.J. Lane of\nGeorgia, Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, Ed Tillman of Dallas,\nTexas, and John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama.\n\n\n\"Parson\" was born November 18, 1850 in Macon, Georgia, at a place called\nTatum Square, where slaves were held, housed and sold. \"Speculators\"\n(persons who traveled from place to place with slaves for sale) had\nhoused 84 slaves there--many of whom were pregnant women. Besides\n\"Parson,\" two other slave-children, Ed Jones who now lives in Sparta,\nGeorgia, and George Bailey were born in Tatum Square that night. The\nmorning after their births, a woman was sent from the nearby A.J. Lane\nplantation to take care of the three mothers; this nurse proved to be\n\"Parson's\" grandmother. His mother told him afterwards that the meeting\nof mother and daughter was very jubilant, but silent and pathetic,\nbecause neither could with safety show her pleasure in finding the\nother. At the auction which was held a few days later, his mother,\nRachel, and her two sons, Solomon Augustus and her infant who was later\nto be known as \"Parson,\" were purchased by A.J. Lane who had previously\nbought \"Parson's\" father, Willis, from a man named Dolphus of Albany,\nGeorgia; thus were husband and wife re-united. They were taken to Lane's\nplantation three miles out of Sparta, Georgia, in Hancock County. Mr.\nLane owned 85 slaves and was known to be very kind and considerate.\n\n\n\"Parson\" lived on the Lane plantation until he was eight years old, when\nhe was sold to Lewis Ripley of Beaufort, South Carolina, with whom he\nlived for two years; he was then sold to Ed Tillman of Dallas, Texas; he\nstayed on the Tillman plantation for about a year and until he was\npurchased by John Troy of Union Springs, Alabama--the richest\nslave-holder in Union Springs, Alabama; he remained with him until\nEmancipation. He recalls that during one of these sales about $800.00\nwas paid for him.\n\n\nHe describes A.J. Lane as being a kind slave-holder who fed his slaves\nwell and whipped them but little. All of his other masters, he states,\nwere nice to children, but lashed and whipped the grown-ups.\n\n\nMr. Lane's family was comprised of his wife, Fannie (who also was very\nkind to the slaves) five children, Harriett Ann, Jennie, Jeff, Frankie\nand Mae Roxie, a brother (whose name he does not recall) who owned a few\nslaves but was kind to those that he did own. Although very young during\nslavery, \"Parson\" remembers many plantation activities and customs,\namong which are the following: That the master's children and those of\nthe slaves on the plantation played together; the farm crops consisted\nof corn, cotton, peas, wheat and oats; that the food for the slaves was\ncooked in pots which were hung over a fire; that the iron ovens used by\nthe slaves had tops for baking; how during the Civil War, wheat, corn\nand dried potatoes were parched and used as substitutes for coffee; that\nhis mother was given a peck of flour every two weeks; that a mixture of\nsalt and sand was dug from the earthern floor of the smokehouse and\nwater poured over it to get the salt drippings for seasoning; that most\nmedicine consisted of boiled roots; when thread and cloth were dyed with\nthe dye obtained from maple bark; when shoes were made on a wooden last\nand soles and uppers fastened together with maple pegs; when the white\npreachers preached \"obey your masters\"; that the first buggy that he saw\nwas owned by his master, A.J. Lane; it had a seat at the rear with rest\nwhich was usually occupied by a man who was called the \"waiter\"; there\nwas no top to the seat and the \"waiter\" was exposed to the weather. He\nrecalls when wooden slats and tightened ropes were used for bed springs;\nalso the patience of \"Aunt Letha\" an old woman slave who took care of\nthe children in the neighborhood while their parents worked, and how\nthey enjoyed watching \"Uncle Umphrey\" tan cow and pig hides.\n\n\n\"Parson\" describes himself as being very frisky as a boy and states that\nhe did but very little work and got but very few whippings. Twice he ran\naway to escape being whipped and hid in asparagus beds in Sparta,\nGeorgia until nightfall; when he returned the master would not whip him\nbecause he was apprehensive that he might run away again and be stolen\nby poorer whites and thus cause trouble. The richer whites, he relates,\nwere afraid of the poorer whites; if the latter were made angry they\nwould round up the owners' sheep and turn them loose into their cotton\nfields and the sheep would eat the cotton, row by row.\n\n\nHe compares the relationship between the rich and poor whites during\nslavery with that of the white and Negro people of today.\n\n\nWith a face full of frowns, \"Parson\" tells of a white man persuading his\nmother to let him tie her to show that he was master, promising not to\nwhip her, and she believed him. When he had placed her in a buck (hands\ntied on a stick so that the stick would turn her in any direction) he\nwhipped her until the blood ran down her back.\n\n\nWith changed expression he told of an incident during the Civil War:\nSlaves, he explained had to have passes to go from one plantation to\nanother and if one were found without a pass the \"patrollers\" would pick\nhim up, return him to his master and receive pay for their service. The\n\"patrollers\" were guards for runaway slaves. One night they came to Aunt\nRhoda's house where a crowd of slaves had gathered and were going to\nreturn them to their masters; Uncle Umphrey the tanner, quickly spaded\nup some hot ashes and pitched it on them; all of the slaves escaped\nunharmed, while all of the \"patrollers\" were badly injured; no one ever\ntold on Uncle Umphrey and when Aunt Rhoda was questioned by her master\nshe stated that she knew nothing about it but told them that the\n\"patrollers\" had brought another \"nigger\" with them; her master took it\nfor granted that she spoke the truth since none of the other Negroes\nwere hurt. He remembers seeing this but does not remember how he, as a\nlittle boy, was prevented from telling about it.\n\n\nAsked about his remembrance or knowledge of the slaves' belief in magic\nand spells he said: \"I remember this and can just see the dogs running\naround now. My mother's brother, \"Uncle Dick\" and \"Uncle July\" swore\nthey would not work longer for masters; so they ran away and lived in\nthe woods. In winter they would put cotton seed in the fields to rot for\nfertilizer and lay in it for warmth. They would kill hogs and slip the\nmeat to some slave to cook for food. When their owners looked for them,\n\"Bob Amos\" who raised \"nigger hounds\" (hounds raised solely to track\nNegro slaves) was summoned and the dogs located them and surrounded them\nin their hide-out; one went one way and one the other and escaped in the\nswamps; they would run until they came to a fence--each kept some\n\"graveyard dust and a few lightwood splinters\" with which they smoked\ntheir feet and jumped the fence and the dogs turned back and could track\nno further. Thus, they stayed in the woods until freedom, when they came\nout and worked for pay. Now, you know \"Uncle Dick\" just died a few years\nago in Sparta, Georgia.\"\n\n\nWhen the Civil War came he remembers hearing one night \"Sherman is\ncoming.\" It was said that Wheeler's Cavalry of the Confederates was\nalways \"running and fighting.\" Lane had moved the family to Macon,\nGeorgia, and they lived on a place called \"Dunlap's Hill.\" That night\nfour preachers were preaching \"Fellow soldiers, the enemy is just here\nto Bolden's Brook, sixteen miles away and you may be carried into\njudgment; prepare to meet your God.\" While they were preaching, bombs\nbegan to fly because Wheeler's Cavalry was only six miles away instead\nof 16 miles; women screamed and children ran. Wheeler kept wagons ahead\nof him so that when one was crippled the other would replace it. He says\nhe imagines he hears the voice of Sherman now, saying: \"Tell Wheeler to\ngo on to South Carolina; we will mow it down with grape shot and plow it\nin with bombshell.\"\n\n\nEmancipation came and with it great rejoicing. He recalls that\nRepublicans were called \"Radicals\" just after the close of the Civil\nWar.\n\n\nMr. Lane was able to save all of his meat, silver, and other valuables\nduring the war by having a cave dug in the hog pasture; the hogs\ntrampled over it daily.\n\n\n\"Parson\" states that among the papers in his trunk he has a piece of\nmoney called \"shin plasters\" which was used during the Civil War.\n\n\nThe slaves were not allowed to attend schools of any kind; and school\nfacilities immediately following Emancipation were very poor; when the\nfirst teacher, Miss Smith, a Yankee, came to Sparta, Georgia and began\nteaching Sunday School, all of the children were given testaments or\ncatechisms which their parents were afraid for them to keep lest their\nmasters whip them, but the teacher called on the parents and explained\nto them that they were as free as their former masters.\n\n\n\"Parson\" states that when he was born, his master named him \"Monk.\" His\ngrandfather, Willis Andrews, who was a free man of Pittsburg,\nPennsylvania, purchased the freedom of his wife Lizzie, but was never\nable to purchase their four children; his father, also named Willis,\ndied a slave, was driven in an ox-cart to a hole that had been dug, put\nin it and covered up; his mother nor children could stop work to attend\nthe funeral, but after the Emancipation, he and a brother returned,\nfound \"Uncle Bob\" who helped bury him and located his grave. Soon after\nhe had been given his freedom, \"Parson\" walked from Union Springs,\nAlabama where his last master had taken him--back to Macon, Georgia, and\nrejoined his mother, Rachel, his brothers, Samuel Augustus, San\nFrancisco, Simon Peter, Lewis, Carter, Powell Wendell and sisters,\nLizzie and Ann; they all dropped the name of their master, Lane, and\ntook the name of their grandfather, Andrews.\n\n\n\"Parson\" possesses an almost uncanny memory and attributes it to his\ninability to write things down and therefore being entirely dependent\nupon his memory. He had passed 30 years of age and had two children who\ncould read and write before he could. His connection with Edward Waters\nCollege has given him a decided advantage for education and there are\nfew things that he cannot discuss intelligently. He has come in contact\nwith thousands of students and all of the ministers connected with the\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church in the State of Florida and has\nattended all of the State and General Conferences of this Church for the\npast half century. He has lived to be 85 years of age and says he will\nlive until he is 106. This he will do because he claims: \"Your life is\nin your hand\" and tells these narratives as proof:\n\n\n\"In 1886 when the present Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was called the\nS.F.W. and I was coming from Savannah to Florida, some tramps intent\nupon robbery had removed spikes from the bridge and just as the alarm\nwas given and the train about to be thrown from the track, I raised the\nwindow and jumped to safety. I then walked back two miles to report it.\nMore than 70 were killed who might have been saved had they jumped as I\ndid. As a result, the S.F. and W. gave me a free pass for life with\nwhich I rode all over the United States and once into Canada.\" He\nproudly displays this pass and states that he would like to travel over\nthe United States again but that the school keeps him too close.\n\n\n\"I had been very sick but took no medicine; my wife went out to visit\nSister Nancy--shortly afterwards I heard what sounded like walking, and\nin my imagination saw death entering, push the door open and draw back\nto leap on me; I jumped through the window, my shirt hung, but I pulled\nit out. Mr. Hodges, a Baptist preacher was hoeing in his garden next\ndoor, looked at me and laughed. A woman yelled 'there goes Reverend\nAndrews, and death is on him.' I said 'no he isn't on me but he's down\nthere.' Pretty soon news came that Reverend Hodges had dropped dead.\nDeath had come for someone and would not leave without them. I was weak\nand he tried me first. Reverend Hodges wasn't looking, so he slipped up\non him.\"\n\n\n\"Parson\" came to Umatilla, Florida, in 1882 from Georgia with a Mr.\nRogers brought him and six other men, their wives and children, to work\non the railroad; he was made the section \"boss\" which job he held until\na white man threatened to \"dock\" him because he was wearing a stiff\nshirt and \"setting over a white man\" when he should have a shovel. This\nwas the opinion of a man in the vicinity, but another white friend,\nnamed Javis warned him and advised him not to leave Umatilla, but\npersuaded him to work for him cutting cord wood; although \"Parson\" had\nnever seen wood corded, he accepted the job and was soon given a pass to\nMacon, Georgia, to get other men; he brought 13 men back and soon became\ntheir \"boss\" and bought a house and decided to do a little hunting. When\nhe left this job he did some hotel work, cooked and served as train\nporter. In 1892 he was ordained to preach and has preached and pastored\nregularly from that time up to two years ago.\n\n\nHe is of medium size and build and partially bald-headed; what little\nhair he has is very grey; he has keen eyes; his eyesight is very good;\nhe has never had to wear glasses. He is as supple as one half his age;\nit is readily demonstrated as he runs, jumps and yells while attending\nthe games of his favorite pastimes, baseball and football. Wherever the\nEdward Waters College football team goes, there \"Parson\" wants to go\nalso. Whenever the crowd at a game hears the scream \"Come on boys,\"\neveryone knows it is \"Parson\" Andrews.\n\n\n\"Parson\" has had two wives, both of whom are dead, and is the father of\neight children: Willis (deceased) Johnny, Sebron Reece of Martin,\nTennessee, Annie Lee, of Macon, Georgia, Hattie of Jacksonville, Ella\n(deceased) Mary Lou Rivers of Macon, Georgia, and Augustus\nsomewhere-at-sea.\n\n\n\"Parson\" does not believe in taking medicine, but makes a liniment with\nwhich he rubs himself. He attributes his long life to his sense of\n\"having quitting sense\" and not allowing death to catch him unawares. He\nasserts that if he reaches the bedside of a kindred in time, he will\nkeep him from dying by telling him: \"Come on now, don't be crazy and\ndie.\"\n\n\nHe states that he enjoyed his slavery life and since that time life has\nbeen very sweet. He knows and remembers most of the incidents connected\nwith members of the several Conferences of the African Methodist\nEpiscopal Church in Florida and can tell you in what minutes you may\nfind any of the important happenings of the past 30 or 40 years.",

        "state": "Florida",
        "text": "Bill Austin--he says his name is NOT Williams--is an ex-slave who gained\nhis freedom because his mistress found it more advantageous to free him\nthan to watch him.\n\n\nAustin lives near Greenwood, Jackson County, Florida, on a small farm\nthat he and his children operate. He says that he does not know his age,\ndoes not remember ever having heard it. But he must be pretty old, he\nsays, \"'cause I was a right smart size when Mistuh Smith went off to\nfight.\" He thinks he may be over a hundred--and he looks it--but he is\nnot sure.\n\n\nAustin was born between Greene and Hancock Counties, on the Oconee\nRiver, in Georgia. He uses the names of the counties interchangeably; he\ncannot be definite as to just which one was his birthplace. \"The line\nbetween 'em was right there by us,\" he says.\n\n\nHis father was Jack; for want of a surname of his own he took that of\nhis father and called himself Jack Smith. During a temporary shortage of\nfunds on his master's part, Jack and Bill's mother was sold to a planter\nin the northern part of the state. It was not until long after his\nemancipation that Bill ever saw either of them again.\n\n\nBill's father Jack was regarded as a fairly good carpenter, mason and\nbricklayer; at times his master would let him do small jobs of repairing\nof building for neighboring planters. These jobs sometimes netted him\nhams, bits of cornmeal, cloth for dresses for his wife and children, and\nother small gifts; these he either used for his small family or\nbartered with the other slaves. Sometimes he sold them to the slaves for\nmoney; cash was not altogether unknown among the slaves on the Smith\nplace.\n\n\nAustin gives an interesting description of his master, Thomas Smith. He\nsays that \"sumptimes he was real rich and all of us had a good time. The\nwuk wasn't hard then, cause if we had big crops he would borrow some\nhe'p from the other white folks. He used to give us meat every day, and\nplenty of other things. One time he bought all of us shoes, and on\nSunday night would let us go to wherever the preacher was holdin'\nmeeting. He used to give my papa money sumptimes, too.\n\n\n\"But they used to whisper that he would gamble a lot. We used to see a\nwhole lot of men come up to the house sumptimes and stay up most of the\nnight. Sumptimes they would stay three or four days. And once in a while\nafter one of these big doings Mistuh Smith would look worried, and we\nwouldn't get no meat and vary little of anything else for a long time.\nHe would be crabby and beat us for any little thing. He used to tell my\npapa that he wouldn't have a d--- cent until he made some crops.\"\n\n\nA few years before he left to enter the war the slave owner came into\npossession of a store near his plantation. This store was in Greensboro.\nEither because the business paid or because of another of his economic\n'bad spells', ownership of his plantation passed to a man named Kimball\nand most of the slaves, with the exception of Bill Austin and one or two\nwomen--either transferred with the plantation or sold. Bill was kept to\ndo errands and general work around the store.\n\n\nBill learned much about the operation of the store, with the result that\nwhen Mr. Smith left with the Southern Army he left his wife and Bill to\ncontinue its operation. By this time there used to be frequent stories\nwhispered among the slaves in the neighborhood--and who came with their\nmasters into the country store--of how this or that slave ran away, and\nwith the white man-power of the section engaged in war, remained at\nlarge for long periods or escaped altogether.\n\n\nThese stories always interested Austin, with the result that one morning\nhe was absent when Mrs. Smith opened the store. He remained away 'eight\nor nine days, I guess', before a friend of the Smiths found him near\nMacon and threatened that he would 'half kill him' if he didn't return\nimmediately.\n\n\nEither the threat--or the fact that in Macon there were no readily\navailable foodstuffs to be eaten all day as in the store--caused Austin\nto return. He was roundly berated by his mistress, but finally forgiven\nby the worried woman who needed his help around the store more than she\nneeded the contrite promises and effusive declarations that he would\n'behave alright for the rest of his life.'\n\n\nAnd he did behave; for several whole months. But by this tine he was 'a\ngreat big boy', and he had caught sight of a young woman who took his\nfancy on his trip to Macon. She was free herself; her father had bought\nher freedom with that of her mother a few years before, and did odd jobs\nfor the white people in the city for a livelihood. Bill had thoughts of\ngoing back to Macon, marrying her, and bringing her back 'to work for\nMissus with me.' He asked permission to go, and was refused on the\ngrounds that his help was too badly needed at the store. Shortly\nafterward he had again disappeared.\n\n\n'Missus', however, knew too much of his plans by this time, and it was\nno difficult task to have him apprehended in Macon. Bill may not have\nhad such great objections to the apprehension, either, he says, because\nby this time he had learned that the young woman in Macon had no\nslightest intention to give up her freedom to join him at Greensboro.\n\n\nA relative of Mrs. Smith gave Austin a sound beating on his return; for\na time it had the desired effect, and he stayed at the store and gave no\nfurther trouble. Mrs. Smith, however, thought of a surer plan of keeping\nhim in Greensboro; she called him and told him he might have his\nfreedom. Bill never attempted to again leave the place--although he did\nnot receive a cent for his work--until his master had died, the store\npassed into the hands of one of Mr. Smith's sons, and the emancipation\nof all the slaves was a matter of eight or ten years' history!\n\n\nWhen he finally left Greene and Hancock Counties--about fifty-five years\nago, Austin settled in Jackson County. He married and began the raising\nof a family. At present he has nineteen living children, more\ngrandchildren than he can accurately tell, and is living with his third\nwife, a woman in her thirties.",

        "text": "Frank Berry, living at 1614 west Twenty-Second street, Jacksonville,\nFlorida, claims to be a grandson of Osceola, last fighting chief of the\nSeminole tribe. Born in 1858 of a mother who was part of the human\nchattel belonging to one of the Hearnses of Alachua County in Florida,\nhe served variously during his life as a State and Federal Government\ncontractor, United States Marshal (1881), Registration Inspector (1879).\n\n\nBeing only eight years of age when the Emancipation Proclamation was\nissued, he remembers little of his life as a slave. The master was kind\nin an impersonal way but made no provision for his freedmen as did many\nother Southerners--usually in the form of land grants--although he gave\nthem their freedom as soon as the proclamation was issued. Berry learned\nfrom his elders that their master was a noted duelist and owned several\nfine pistols some of which have very bloody histories.\n\n\nIt was during the hectic days that followed the Civil War that Berry\nserved in the afore-mentioned offices. He held his marshalship under a\nJudge King of Jacksonville, Florida. As State and Federal Government\nContractor he built many public structures, a few of which are still in\nuse, among them the jetties at Mayport, Florida which he helped to build\nand a jail at High Springs, Florida.\n\n\nIt was during the war between the Indians and settlers that Berry's\ngrandmother, serving as a nurse at Tampa Bay was captured by the Indians\nand carried away to become the squaw of their chief; she was later\nre-captured by her owners. This was a common procedure, according to\nBerry's statements. Indians often captured slaves, particularly the\nwomen, or aided in their escape and almost always intermarried with\nthem. The red men were credited with inciting many uprisings and\nwholesale escapes among the slaves.\n\n\nCountry frolics (dances) were quite often attended by Indians, whose\nmain reason for going was to obtain whiskey, for which they had a very\nstrong fondness. Berry describes an intoxicated Indian as a \"tornado mad\nman\" and recalls a hair raising incident that ended in tragedy for the\noffender.\n\n\nA group of Indians were attending one of these frolics at Fort Myers\nand everything went well until one of the number became intoxicated,\nterrorizing the Negroes with bullying, and fighting anyone with whom he\ncould \"pick\" a quarrel. \"Big Charlie\" an uncle of the narrator was\npresent and when the red man challenged him to a fight made a quick end\nof him by breaking his neck at one blow.\n\n\nFor two years he was hounded by revengeful Indians, who had an uncanny\nway of ferreting out his whereabouts no matter where he went. Often he\nsighted them while working in the fields and would be forced to flee to\nsome other place. This continued with many hairbreadth escapes, until he\nwas forced to move several states away.\n\n\nBerry recalls the old days of black aristocracy when Negroes held high\npolitical offices in the state of Florida, when Negro tradesmen and\nprofessionals competed successfully and unmolested with the whites. Many\nfortunes were made by men who are now little more than beggars. To this\ngroup belongs the man who in spite of reduced circumstances manages\nstill to make one think of top hats and state affairs. Although small of\nstature and almost disabled by rheumatism, he has the fiery dignity and\nstraight back that we associate with men who have ruled others. At the\nsame time he might also be characterized as a sweet old person, with all\nthe tender reminiscences of the old days and the and childish\nprejudices against all things new. As might be expected, he lives in the\npast and always is delighted whenever he is asked to tell about the only\nlife that he has ever really lived. Together with his aged wife he lives\nwith his children and is known to local relief agencies who supplement\nthe very small income he now derives from what is left of what was at\none time a considerable fortune.",

        "age": "26",
        "address": "Florida",
        "state": "Florida",
        "text": "Mary Minus Biddie, age one hundred five was born in Pensacola, Florida,\n1833, and raised in Columbia County. She is married, and has several\nchildren. For her age she is exceptionally active, being able to wash\nand do her house work. With optimism she looks forward to many more\nyears of life. Her health is excellent.\n\n\nHaving spent thirty-two years of her life as a slave she relates vividly\nsome of her experiences.\n\n\nHer master Lancaster Jamison was a very kind man and never mistreated\nhis slaves. He was a man of mediocre means, and instead of having a\nlarge plantation as was usual in those days, he ran a boarding house,\nthe revenue therefrom furnishing him substance for a livelihood. He had\na small farm from which fresh produce was obtained to supply the needs\nof his lodgers. Mary's family were his only slaves. The family consisted\nof her mother, father, brother and a sister. The children called the old\nmaster \"Fa\" and their father \"Pappy.\" The master never resented this\nappellation, and took it in good humor. Many travelers stopped at his\nboarding house; Mary's mother did the cooking, her father \"tended\" the\nfarm, and Mary, her brother and sister, did chores about the place.\nThere was a large one-room house built in the yard in which the family\nlived. Her father had a separate garden in which he raised his produce,\nalso a smokehouse where the family meats were kept. Meats were smoked\nin order to preserve them.\n\n\nDuring the day Mary's father was kept so busy attending his master's\nfarm that there was no time for him to attend to a little farm that he\nwas allowed to have. He overcame this handicap, however, by setting up\nhuge scaffolds in the field which he burned and from the flames that\nthis fire emitted he could see well enough to do what was necessary to\nhis farm.\n\n\nThe master's first wife was a very kind woman; at her death Mary's\nmaster moved from Pensacola to Columbia County.\n\n\nMary was very active with the plow, she could handle it with the agility\nof a man. This prowess gained her the title of \"plow girl.\"\n\n\n\n\nCOOKING.\n\n\nStoves were unknown and cooking was done in a fireplace that was built\nof clay, a large iron rod was built in across the opening of the\nfireplace on which were hung pots that had special handles that fitted\nabout the rod holding them in place over the blazing fire as the food\ncooking was done in a moveable oven which was placed in the fireplace\nover hot coals or corn cobs. Potatoes were roasted in ashes. Oft' times\nMary's father would sit in front of the fireplace until a late hour in\nthe night and on arising in the morning the children would find in a\ncorner a number of roasted potatoes which their father had thoughtfully\nroasted and which the children readily consumed.\n\n\n\n\nLIGHTING SYSTEM.\n\n\nMatches were unknown; a flint rock and a file provided the fire. This\noccured by striking a file against a flint rock which threw off sparks\nthat fell into a wad of dry cotton used for the purpose. This cotton, as\na rule, readily caught fire. This was fire and all the fire needed to\nstart any blaze.\n\n\n\n\nWEAVING.\n\n\nThe white folk wove the cloth on regular looms which were made into\ndresses for the slaves. For various colors of cloth the thread was dyed.\nThe dye was made by digging up red shank and wild indigo roots which\nwere boiled. The substance obtained being some of the best dye to be\nfound.\n\n\n\n\nBEVERAGES & FOOD.\n\n\nBread was made from flour and wheat. The meat used was pork, beef,\nmutton and goat. For preservation it was smoked and kept in the\nsmokehouse. Coffee was used as a beverage and when this ran out as oft'\ntimes happened, parched peanuts were used for the purpose.\n\n\nMary and family arose before daybreak and prepared breakfast for the\nmaster and his family, after which they ate in the same dining room.\nWhen this was over the dishes were washed by Mary, her brother and\nsister. The children then played about until meals were served again.\n\n\n\n\nWASHING and SOAP.\n\n\nWashing was done in home-made wooden tubs, and boiling in iron pots\nsimilar to those of today. Soap was made from fat and lye.\n\n\n\n\nAMUSEMENTS.\n\n\nThe only amusement to be had was a big candy pulling, or hog killing and\nchicken cooking. The slaves from the surrounding plantations were\nallowed to come together on these occasions. A big time was had.\n\n\n\n\nCHURCH.\n\n\nThe slaves went to the \"white folks\" church on Sundays. They were seated\nin the rear of the church. The white minister would arise and exhort the\nslaves to 'mind your masters, you owe them your respect.' An old\nChristian slave who perceived things differently could sometimes be\nheard to mumble, \"Yeah, wese jest as good as deys is only deys white and\nwe's black, huh.\" She dare not let the whites hear this. At times\nmeetin's were held in a slave cabin where some \"inspired\" slave led the\nservices.\n\n\nIn the course of years Mr. Jamison married again. His second wife was a\nveritable terror. She was always ready and anxious to whip a slave for\nthe least misdemeanor. The master told Mary and her mother that before\nhe would take the chance of them running away on account of her meanness\nhe would leave her. As soon as he would leave the house this was a\nsignal for his wife to start on a slave. One day, with a kettle of hot\nwater in her hand, she chased Mary, who ran to another plantation and\nhid there until the good master returned. She then poured out her\ntroubles to him. He was very indignant and remonstrated with his wife\nfor being so cruel. She met her fate in later years; her son-in-law\nbecoming angry at some of her doings in regard to him shot her, which\nresulted in her death. Instead of mourning, everybody seemed to rejoice,\nfor the menace to well being had been removed. Twice a year Mary's\nfather and master went to Cedar Keys, Florida to get salt. Ocean water\nwas obtained and boiled, salt resulting. They always returned with about\nthree barrels of salt.\n\n\nThe greatest event in the life of a slave was about to occur, and the\nmost sorrowful in the life of a master, FREEDOM was at hand. A Negro was\nseen coming in the distance, mounted upon a mule, approaching Mr.\nJamison who stood upon the porch. He told him of the liberation of the\nslaves. Mr. Jamison had never before been heard to curse, but this was\none day that he let go a torrent of words that are unworthy to appear in\nprint. He then broke down and cried like a slave who was being lashed by\nhis cruel master. He called Mary's mother and father, Phyliss and Sandy,\n\"I ain't got no more to do with you, you are free,\" he said, \"if you\nwant to stay with me you may and I'll give you one-third of what you\nraise.\" They decided to stay. When the crop was harvested the master did\nnot do as he had promised. He gave them nothing. Mary slipped away,\nmounted the old mule \"Mustang\" and galloped away at a mules snail speed\nto Newnansville where she related what had happened to a Union captain.\nHe gave her a letter to give to Mr. Jamison. In it he reminded him that\nif he didn't give Mary's family what he had promised he would be put in\njail. Without hesitation the old master complied with these pungent\norders.\n\n\nAfter this incident Mary and her family left the good old boss to seek a\nnew abode in other parts. This was the first time that the master had in\nany way displayed any kind of unfairness toward them, perhaps it was the\nreaction to having to liberate them.\n\n\n\n\nMARRIAGE.\n\n\nThere was no marriage during slavery according to civil or religious\ncustom among the slaves. If a slave saw a woman whom he desired he told\nhis master. If the woman in question belonged on another plantation, the\nmaster would consult her master: \"one of my boys wants to marry one of\nyour gals,\" he would say. As a rule it was agreeable that they should\nlive together as man and wife. This was encouraged for it increased the\nslave population by new borns, hence, being an asset to the masters.\nThe two slaves thus joined were allowed to see one another at intervals\nupon special permission from the master. He must have a pass to leave\nthe plantation. Any slave caught without one while off the plantation\nwas subject to be caught by the \"paderollers\" (a low class of white who\nroved the country to molest a slave at the least opportunity. Some of\nthem were hired by the masters to guard against slaves running away or\nto apprehend them in the event that they did) who would beat them\nunmercifully, and send them back to the plantation from whence they\ncame.\n\n\nAs a result of this form of matrimony at emancipation there were no\nslaves lawfully married. Orders were given that if they preferred to\nlive together as man and wife they must marry according to law. They\nwere given nine months to decide this question, after which if they\ncontinued to live together they were arrested for adultery. A Mr. Fryer,\nJustice of the Peace at Gainesville, was assigned to deal with the\nsituation around the plantation where Mary and her family lived. A big\nsupper was given, it was early, about twenty-five slave couples\nattended. There was gaiety and laughter. A barrel of lemonade was\nserved. A big time was had by all, then those couples who desired to\nremain together were joined in wedlock according to civil custom. The\nparty broke up in the early hours of the morning.\n\n\nMary Biddie, cognizant of the progress that science and invention has\nmade in the intervening years from Emancipation and the present time,\ncould not help but remark of the vast improvement of the lighting system\nof today and that of slavery. There were no lamps or kerosene. The first\nthread that shearer spun was for a wick to be used in a candle, the only\nmeans of light. Beef tallow was used to make the candle; this was placed\nin a candle mould while hot. The wick was then placed in the center of\nthe tallow as it rest in the mould; this was allowed to cool. When this\nchemical process occured there was a regular sized candle to be used\nfor lighting.\n\n\nMary now past the century mark, her lean bronze body resting in a\nrocker, her head wrapped in a white 'kerchief, and puffing slowly on her\nclay pipe, expressed herself in regard to presidents: \"Roosevelt has\ndon' mo' than any other president, why you know ever since freedom they\nbeen talkin' 'bout dis pension, talkin' 'bout it tha's all, but you see\nMr. Roosevelt he don' com' an' gived it tu us. What? I'll say he's a\ngood rightus man, an' um sho' go' vot' fo' him.\"\n\n\nResiding in her little cabin in Eatonville, Florida, she is able to\nsmile because she has some means of security, the Old Age Pension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDADE COUNTY, FLORIDA, FOLKLORE\nEx-Slaves\n\n\nREV. ELI BOYD\n\n\n\n\nReverend Eli Boyd was born May 29, 1864, four miles from Somerville,\nSouth Carolina on John Murray's plantation. It was a large plantation\nwith perhaps one hundred slaves and their families. As he was only a\ntiny baby when freedom came, he had no \"recomembrance\" of the real\nslavery days, but he lived on the same plantation for many years until\nhis father and mother died in 1888.\n\n\n\"I worked on the plantation just like they did in the real slavery days,\nonly I received a small wage. I picked cotton and thinned rice. I always\ndid just what they told me to do and didn't ever get into any trouble,\nexcept once and that was my own fault.\n\n\n\"You see it was this way. They gave me a bucket of thick clabber to take\nto the hogs. I was hungry and took the bucket and sat down behind the\nbarn and ate every bit of it. I didn't know it would make me sick, but\nwas I sick? I swelled up so that I all but bust. They had to doctor on\nme. They took soot out of the chimney and mixed it with salt and made me\ntake that. I guess they saved my life, for I was awful sick.\n\n\n\"I never learned to read until I was 26 years old. That was after I left\nthe plantation. I was staying at a place washing dishes for Goodyear's\nat Sapville, Georgia, six miles from Waycross. I found a Webster's\nspelling book that had been thrown away, and I learned to read from\nthat.\n\n\n\"I wasn't converted until I went to work in a turpentine still and five\nyears later I was called to preach. I am one of thirteen children and\nnone of us has ever been arrested. We were taught right.\n\n\n\"I kept on preaching until I came to Miami. I have been assistant pastor\nat Bethel African Methodist Church for the past ten years.\n\n\n\"I belong to a class of Negroes called Geechees. My grandfather was\nbrought directly from Africa to Port Royal, South Carolina. My\ngrandmother used to hold up her hand and look at it and sing out of her\nhand. She'd make them up as she would look at her hand. She sang in\nGeechee and also made rhymes and songs in English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\n\n\nCora Taylor\nFrances H. Miner, Editor\nMiami, Florida\n\n\nRIVANA BOYNTON [TR: also reported as Riviana.]\n\n\n\n\n1. Where, and about when, were you born?\n\n\nSome time in 1850 on John and Mollie Hoover's plantation between\nSavannah and Charleston near the Georgia line.\n\n\n2. If you were born on a plantation or farm, what sort of farming\nsection was it in?\n\n\nThey raised rice, corn wheat, and lots of cotton, raised everything they\net--vegetables, taters and all that.\n\n\n3. How did you pass the time as a child? What sort of chores did you do\nand what did you play?\n\n\nI had to thin cotton in the fields and mind the flies at the table. I\nchased them with a fly bush, sometimes a limb from a tree and sometimes\nwid a fancy bush.\n\n\n4. Was your master kind to you?\n\n\nYes, I was favored by being with my massy.\n\n\n5. How many slaves were there on the same plantation and farm?\n\n\nI don't know. There was plenty o' dem up in de hundreds, I reckon.\n\n\n6. Do you remember what kind of cooking utensils your mother used?\n\n\nYes, dey had spiders an' big iron kettles that dey hung in de chimney by\na long chain. When dey wanted to cook fast dey lowered de chain and when\ndey wanted to bake in the spiders, they's put them under de kettle can\ncover with coals until dey was hot. Dey'd put de pones in does double\nconcerned spiders and turn them around when dey was done on one side.\n\n\n7. What were your main foods and how were they cooked?\n\n\nWe had everything you could think of to eat.\n\n\n8. Do you remember making imitation or substitute coffee by grinding up\ncorn or peanuts?\n\n\nNo. We had real coffee.\n\n\n9. Do you remember ever having, when you were young, any other kind of\nbread besides corn bread?\n\n\nYes, batter and white bread.\n\n\n10. Do you remember evaporating sea water to get salt?\n\n\n[TR: word illegible] did hit dat way.\n\n\n11. When you were a child, what sort of stove do you remember your\nmother having? Did they have a hanging pot in the fire place, and did\nthey make their candles of their own tallow?\n\n\nAlways had fireplaces or open fires on the plantation, but after a long\ntime while my massy had hearth stoves to cook on. De would give us\nslaves pot liquor to cook green in sometimes. Dey lit de fires with\nflint and steel, when it would go out. We all ate with wooden paddles\nfor spoons. We made dem taller candles out of beef and mutton tallow,\nden we'd shoog 'em down into the candle sticks made of tin pans wid a\nhandle on and a holder for the candle in the center. You know how.\n\n\n12. Did you use an open well or pump to get the water?\n\n\nWe had a well with two buckets on a pulley to draw the water.\n\n\n13. Do you remember when you first saw ice in regular form?\n\n\nNo. Ice would freeze in winter in our place.\n\n\n14. Did your family work in the rice fields or in the cotton on the\nfarm, or what sort of work did they do?\n\n\nThey did all kinds of work in the fields.\n\n\n15. If they worked in the house or about the place, what sort of work\ndid they do?\n\n\nI was house maid and did everything they told me to do. Sometimes I'd\nsweep and work around all the time.\n\n\n16. Do you remember ever helping tan and cure hides and pig hides?\n\n\nThis was done on the plantation. I took no part in it.\n\n\n17. As a young person what sort of work did you do? If you helped your\nmother around the house or cut firewood or swept the yard, say so.\n\n\nI helped do the housework and did what the mistress told me do.\n\n\n18. When you were a child do you remember how people wove cloth, or spun\nthread, or picked out cotton seed, or weighed cotton or what sort of bag\nwas used on the cotton bales?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n19. Do you remember what sort of soap they used? How did they get the\nlye for making the soap?\n\n\nYes, I'd help to make the ash lye and soft soap. Never seed and cake\nsoap until I came here.\n\n\n20. What did they use for dyeing thread and cloth and how did they dye\nthem?\n\n\nThey used indigo for blue, copperas for yellow, and red oak chips for\nred.\n\n\n21. Did your mother use big, wooden washtubs with cut-out holes on each\nside for the fingers?\n\n\nYes, and dey had smaller wooden keels. Never seed any tin tubs up there.\n\n\n22. Do you remember the way they made shoes by hand in the country?\n\n\nYes, they made all our shoes on the plantation.\n\n\n23. Do you remember saving the chicken feathers and goose feathers\nalways for your featherbeds?\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n23. Do you remember when women wore hoop [TR: illegible] in their skirts\nand when they stopped wearing them and wore narrow skirts?\n\n\nYes. My missus, she made me a pair of hoops, or I guess she bought it,\nbut some of the slaves took thin limbs from trees and made their hoops.\nOthers made them out of stiff paper and others would starch their skirts\nstiff with rice starch to make their skirts stand way out. We thought\nthose hoops were just the thing for style.\n\n\n25. Do you remember when you first saw your first windmill?\n\n\nYes. They didn't have them there.\n\n\n26. Do you remember when you first saw bed springs instead of bed ropes?\n\n\nI slept in a gunny bunk. My missus had a rope bed and she covered the\nropes with a cow hide. We made hay and corn shuck mattresses for her.\nWe'd cut the hay and shucks up fine and stuff the ticks with them. The\ncow hides were placed on top of the mattresses to protect them.\n\n\n27. When did you see the first buggy and what did it look like?\n\n\nIt was a buggy like you see.\n\n\n28. Do you remember your grandparents?\n\n\nNo. My mother was sold from me when I was small. I stayed in my uncle's\nshed at night.\n\n\n29. Do you remember the money called \"shin-plasters\"?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n30. What interesting historical events happened during your youth, such\nas Sherman's army passing through your section? Did you witness the\nhappenings and what was the reaction of the other Negroes to them?\n\n\nI remember well when de war was on. I used to turn the big corn sheller\nand sack the shelled corn for the Confederate soldiers. They used to\nsell some of the corn and they gave some of it to the soldiers. Anyway\nthe Yankees got some and they did not expect them to get it. It was this\nway: The Wheeler boys came through there ahead of Sherman's Army. Now,\nwe thought the Wheeler boys were Confederates. They came down the road\nas happy as could be, a-singin'\n\n\n  \"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah\n  Hurrah for the Broke Book Boys\n  Hurrah for the Broke Brook Boys of South Carolina.\"\n\n\nSo of course we thought they were our soldiers a-singin' our songs.\nWell, they came an' tol' our boss that Sherman's soldiers were coming'\nand we'd better hide all our food and valuable things, for they'd take\neverything they wanted. So we \"hoped\" our Massy hide the tings. They dug\nholes and buried the potatoes and covered them with cotton seed and all\nthat. Then our ma say give dem food and thanked them for their kindness\nand he set out wid two of the girls to tote them to safety, but before\nhe got back after the missus the Yanks were on us.\n\n\nOur missus had od[TR:?] led us together and told us what to say. \"Now\nyou beg for me. If they ask you whether I've been good to you, you tell\n'em 'yes'. If they ask you if we give you meat, you say 'yes'.\" Now de\nres' didn't git any meat, but I did, 'cause I worked in the house. So I\ndidn't tell a lie, for I did git meat.\n\n\nSo we begged, an' we say, \"Our missus is good. Don't you kill her. Don't\nyou take our meat away from us. Don't you hurt her. Don't you burn her\nhouse down.\" So they burned the stable and some of the other buildings,\nbut they did not burn the house nor hurt us any. We saw the rest of the\nYanks comin'. They never stopped for nothin'. Their horses would jump\nthe worn rail fences and they come 'cross fields 'n everything. They\nbound our missus upstairs so she couldn't get away, then they came to\nthe sheds and we begged and begged for her. Then they loosed her, but\nthey took some of us for refugees and some of the slaves went off with\nthem of their own will. They took all the things that were buried all\nthe hams and everything they wanted. But they did not burn the house and\nour missus was saved.\n\n\n31. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted or joined the northern army?\nYes.\n\n\n32. Did you know any Negroes who enlisted in the southern army?\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n33. Did your master join the confederacy?

Simms, Editor\nTitusville, Florida\nSeptember 25, 1936\n\n\nTITUS I. BYNES\n\n\n\n\nTitus B. [TR: Titus I. above] Bynes, affectionately known as \"Daddy\nBynes\", is reminiscent of Harriet Beecher Stowe's immortal \"Uncle Tom\"\nand Joel Chandler Harris' inimitable 'Uncle Remus' with his white beard\nand hair surrounding a smiling black face. He was born in November 1846\nin what is now Clarendon County, South Carolina. Both his father, Cuffy,\nand mother, Diana, belonged to Gabriel Flowden who owned 75 or 80 slaves\nand was noted for his kindness to them.\n\n\nBynes' father was a common laborer, and his mother acted in the capacity\nof chambermaid and spinner. They had 12 children, seven boys--Abraham,\nTutus[TR:?], Reese, Lawrence, Thomas, Billie, and Hamlet--and five\ngirls--Charity, Chrissy, Fannie, Charlotte, and Violet.\n\n\nWhen Titus was five or six years of age he was given to Flowden's wife\nwho groomed him for the job of houseboy. Although he never received any\neducation, Bynes was quick to learn. He could tell the time of day and\ncould distinguish one newspaper from another. He recalled an incident\nwhich happened when he was about eight years of age which led him to\nconceal his precociousness. One day while writing on the ground, he\nheard his mistress' little daughter tell her mother that he was writing\nabout water. Mistress Flowden called him and told him that if he were\ncaught writing again his right arm would be cut off. From then on his\nprecociousness vanished. In regards to religion, Bynes can recall the\nSunday services very vividly; and he tells how the Negroes who were\nseated in the gallery first heard a sermon by the white minister and\nthen after these services they would gather on the main floor and hear a\nsermon by a Negro preacher.\n\n\nBynes served in the Civil War with his boss, and he can remember the\nregiment camp between Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina.\nHis mistress would not permit Bynes to accompany his master to Virginia\nto join the Hampton Legion on the grounds that it was too cold for him.\nAnd thus ended his war days! When he was 20 years of age, his father\nturned him loose. Young Bynes rented 14 acres of land from Arthur Harven\nand began farming.\n\n\nIn 1868 he left South Carolina and came to Florida. He settled in\nEnterprise (now Benson Springs), Velusia County where he worked for J.C.\nHayes, a farmer, for one year, after which he homesteaded. He next\nbecame a carpenter and, as he says himself, \"a jack of all trades and\nmaster of none.\" He married shortly after coming to Florida and is the\nfather of three sons--\"as my wife told me,\" he adds with a twinkle in\nhis eyes. His wife is now dead. He was prevailed upon while very ill to\nenter the Titusville Poor Farm where he has been for almost two years.\n(2)\n\n\n\n\nDella Bess Hilyard (\"Aunt Bess\")\n\n\nDella Bess Hilyard, or \"Aunt Bess\" as she is better known, was born in\nDarlington, South Carolina in 1858, the daughter of Resier and Zilphy\nHart, slaves of Gus Hiwards. Both her parents were cotton pickers and as\na little girl Della often went with her parents into the fields. One day\nshe stated that the Yankees came through South Carolina with Knapsacks\non their shoulders. It wasn't until later that she learned the reason.\n\n\nWhen asked if she received any educational training, \"Aunt Bess\" replied\nin the negative, but stated that the slaves on the Hiwards plantation\nwere permitted to pick up what education they could without fear of\nbeing molested. No one bothered, however, to teach them anything.\n\n\nIn regards to religion, \"Aunt Bess\" said that the slaves were not told\nabout heaven; they were told to honor their masters and mistresses and\nof the damnation which awaited them for disobedience.\n\n\nAfter slavery the Hart family moved to Georgia where Della grew into\nwomanhood and at an early age married Caleb Bess by whom she had two\nchildren. After the death of Bess, about fifteen years ago, \"Aunt Bess\"\nmoved to Fort Pierce, Florida. While there she married Lonny Hilyard\nwho brought her to Titusville where she now resides, a relic of bygone\ndays. (3)\n\n\n\n\nTaylor Gilbert\n\n\nTaylor Gilbert was born in Shellman, Georgia, 91 years ago, of a colored\nmother and a white father, \"which is why I am so white\", he adds. He has\nnever been known to have passed as white, however, in spite of the fact\nthat he could do so without detection. David Ferguson bought Jacob\nGilbert from Dr. Gilbert as a husband for Emily, Taylor's mother. Emily\nhad nine children, two by a white man, Frances and Taylor, and seven by\nJacob, only three of whom Gilbert remembers--Gettie, Rena, and Annis.\nTwo of these children were sent to school while the others were obliged\nto work on the plantation. Emily, the mother, was the cook and washwoman\nwhile Jacob was the Butler.\n\n\nGilbert, a good sized lad when slavery was at its height, recalls\nvividly the cruel lashings and other punishments meted out to those who\ndisobeyed their master or attempted to run away. It was the custom of\nslaves who wished to go from one plantation to another to carry passes\nin case they were stopped as suspected runaways. Frequently slaves would\nvisit without benefit of passes, and as result they suffered severe\ntorturing. Often the sons of the slaves' owners would go \"nigger\nhunting\" and nothing--not even murder was too horrible for them to do to\nslaves caught without passes. They justified their fiendish acts by\nsaying the \"nigger tried to run away when told to stop.\"\n\n\nGilbert cannot remember when he came to Florida, but he claims that it\nwas many years ago. Like the majority of Negroes after slavery, he\nbecame a farmer which occupation he still pursues. He married once but\n\"my wife got to messin' around with another man so I sent her home to\nher mother.\" He can be found in Miami, Florida, where he may be seen\ndaily hobbling around on his cane.

Her mother Tempy, belonged to Bullock, while her father Arnold\nMerritt, belonged to Edward Merritt, a large plantation owner. According\nto Patience, her mother's owner was very kind, her father's very cruel.\nBullock had very few slaves, but Merritt had a great many of them, not a\nfew of whom he sold at the slave markets.\n\n\nPatience spent most of her time playing in the sand when she was a\nchild, while her parents toiled in the fields for their respective\nowners. Her grandparents on her mother's side belonged to Bullock, but\nof her father's people she knew nothing as \"they didn't come to this\ncountry.\" When asked where they lived, she replied \"in South Carolina.\"\n\n\nSince she lived with her mother, Patience fared much better than had she\nlived with her father. Her main foods included meats, greens, rice, corn\nbread which was replaced by biscuits on Sunday morning. Coffee was made\nfrom parched corn or meal and was the chief drink. The food was cooked\nin large iron pots and pans in an open fireplace and seasoned with salt\nobtained by evaporating sea water.\n\n\nWater for all purposes was drawn from a well. In order to get soap to\nwash with, the cook would save all the grease left from the cooking. Lye\nwas obtained by mixing oak ashes with water and allowing them to decay;\nTubs were made from large barrels.\n\n\nWhen she was about seven or eight, Patience assisted other children\nabout her age and older in picking out cotton seeds from the picked\ncotton. After the cotton was weighed on improved scales, it was bound in\nbags made of hemp.\n\n\nSpinning and weaving were taught Patience when she was about ten.\nAlthough the cloth and thread were dyed various colors, she knows only\nhow blue was obtained by allowing the indigo plant to rot in water and\nstraining the result.\n\n\nPatience's father was not only a capable field worker but also a\nfinished shoemaker. After tanning and curing his hides by placing them\nin water with oak bark for several days and then exposing them to the\nsun to dry, he would cut out the uppers and the soles after measuring\nthe foot to be shod. There would be an inside sole as well as an outside\nsole tacked together by means of small tacks made of maple wood. Sewing\nwas done on the shoes by means of flax thread.\n\n\nPatience remembers saving the feathers from all the fowl to make feather\nbeds. She doesn't remember when women stopped wearing hoops in their\nskirts nor when bed springs replaced bed ropes. She does remember,\nhowever, that these things were used.\n\n\nShe saw her first windmill about 36 years ago, ten years before she went\nblind. She remembers seeing buggies during slavery time, little light\ncarriages, some with two wheels and some with four. She never heard of\nany money called \"shin-plasters,\" and she became money-conscious during\nthe war when Confederate currency was introduced. When the slaves were\nsick, they were given castor oil, turpentine and medicines made from\nvarious roots and herbs.\n\n\nPatience's master joined the confederacy, but her father's master did\nnot. [Although Negroes could enlist in the Southern army if they\ndesired,] none of them wished to do so but preferred to join northern\nforces and fight for the thing they desired most, freedom. When freedom\nwas no longer a dream, but a reality, the Merritts started life on their\nown as farmers. Twelve-year old Patience entered one of the schools\nestablished by the Freedmen's Bureau. She recalls the gradual growth of\nNegro settlements, the churches and the rise and fall of the Negroes\npolitically.",

        "text": "The life of Florida Clayton is interesting in that it illustrates the\nmiscegenation prevalent during the days of slavery. Interesting also is\nthe fact that Florida was not a slave even though she was a product\nof those turbulent days. Many years before her birth--March 1,\n1854--Florida's great grandfather, a white man, came to Tallahassee,\nFlorida from Washington, District of Columbia, with his children whom he\nhad by his Negro slave. On coming to Florida, he set all of his children\nfree except one boy, Amos, who was sold to a Major Ward. For what reason\nthis was done, no one knew. Florida, named for the state in which she\nwas born, was one of seven children born to Charlotte Morris (colored)\nwhose father was a white man and David Clayton (white).\n\n\nFlorida, in a retrogressive mood, can recall the \"nigger hunters\" and\n\"nigger stealers\" of her childhood days. Mr. Nimrod and Mr. Shehee, both\nwhite, specialized in catching runaway slaves with their trained\nbloodhounds. Her parents always warned her and her brothers and sisters\nto go in someone's yard whenever they saw these men with their dogs lest\nthe ferocious animals tear them to pieces. In regards to the \"nigger\nstealers,\" Florida tells of a covered wagon which used to come to\nTallahassee at regular intervals and camp in some secluded spot. The\nchildren, attracted by the old wagon, would be eager to go near it, but\nthey were always told that \"Dry Head and Bloody Bones,\" a ghost who\ndidn't like children, was in that wagon. It was not until later years\nthat Florida and the other children learned that the driver of the wagon\nwas a \"nigger stealer\" who stole children and took them to Georgia to\nsell at the slave markets.\n\n\nWhen she was 11 years old, Florida saw the surrender of Tallahassee to\nthe Yankees. Three years later she came to Jacksonville to live with her\nsister. She married but is now divorced after 12 years of marriage.\n\n\nThree years ago she entered the Old Folks Home at 1627 Franklin Street\nto live.\n\n\n\n\n1. Personal Interview with Florida Clayton, 1627 Franklin Street,\nJacksonville, Florida\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\n\n\nViola B. Muse, Field Worker\nJacksonville, Florida\nDecember 3, 1936\n\n\n\"FATHER\" CHARLES COATES\n\n\n\n\n\"Father\" Charles Coates, as he is called by all who know him, was born a\nslave, 108 years ago at Richmond, Virginia, on the plantation of a man\nnamed L'Angle. His early boyhood days was spent on the L'Angle place\nfilled with duties such as minding hogs, cows, bringing in wood and such\nlight work. His wearing apparel consisted of one garment, a shirt made\nto reach below the knees and with three-quarter sleeves. He wore no\nshoes until he was a man past 20 years of age.\n\n\nThe single garment was worn summer and winter alike and the change in\nthe weather did not cause an extra amount of clothes to be furnished for\nthe slaves. They were required to move about so fast at work that the\nheat from the body was sufficient to keep them warm.\n\n\nWhen Charles was still a young man Mr. L'Angle sold him on time payment\nto W.B. Hall; who several years before the Civil War moved from Richmond\nto Washington County, Georgia, carrying 135 grown slaves and many\nchildren. Mr. Hall made Charles his carriage driver, which kept him from\nhard labor. Other slaves on the plantation performed such duties as rail\nsplitting, digging up trees by the roots and other hard work.\n\n\nCharles Coates remembers vividly the cruelties practiced on the Hall\nplantation. His duty was to see that all the slaves reported to work on\ntime. The bell was rung at 5:30 a.m. by one of the slaves. Charles had\nthe ringing of the bell for three years; this was in addition to the\ncarriage driving. He tells with laughter how the slaves would \"grab a\npiece of meat and bread and run to the field\" as no time was allowed to\nsit and eat breakfast. This was a very different way from that of the\nmaster he had before, as Mr. L'Angle was much better to his slaves.\n\n\nMr. Hall was different in many ways from Mr. L'Angle, \"He was always\npretending\" says Charles that he did not want his slaves beaten\nunmercifully. Charles being close to Mr. Hall during work hours had\nopportunity to see and hear much about what was going on at the\nplantation. And he believes that Mr. Hall knew just how the overseer\ndealt with the slaves.\n\n\nOn the Hall plantation there was a contraption, similar to a gallows,\nwhere the slaves were suspended and whipped. At the top of this device\nwere blocks of wood with chains run through holes and high enough that a\nslave when tied to the chains by his fingers would barely touch the\nground with his toes. This was done so that the slave could not shout or\ntwist his body while being whipped. The whipping was prolonged until the\nbody of the slave covered with welts and blood trickled down his naked\nbody. Women were treated in the same manner, and a pregnant woman\nreceived no more leniency than did a man. Very often after a severe\nflogging a slave's body was treated to a bath of water containing salt\nand pepper so that the pain would be more lasting and aggravated. The\nwhipping was done with sticks and a whip called the \"cat o' nine tails,\"\nmeaning every lick meant nine. The \"cat o' nine tails\" was a whip of\nnine straps attached to a stick; the straps were perforated so that\neverywhere the hole in the strap fell on the flesh a blister was left.\n\n\nThe treatment given by the overseer was very terrifying. He relates how\na slave was put in a room and locked up for two and three days at a time\nwithout water or food, because the overseer thought he hadn't done\nenough work in a given time.\n\n\nAnother offense which brought forth severe punishment was that of\ncrossing the road to another plantation. A whipping was given and very\noften a slave was put on starvation for a few days.\n\n\nOne privilege given slaves on the plantation was appreciated by all and\nthat was the opportunity to hear the word of God. The white people\ngathered in log and sometimes frame churches and the slaves were\npermitted to sit about the church yard on wagons and on the ground and\nlisten to the preaching. When the slaves wanted to hold church they had\nto get special permission from the master, and at that time a slave hut\nwas used. A white Preacher was called in and he would preach to them not\nto steal, lie or run away and \"be sure and git all dem weeds outen dat\ncorn in de field and your master will think a heap of you.\" Charles does\nnot remember anything else the preacher told them about God. They\nlearned more about God when they sat outside the church waiting to drive\ntheir masters and family back home.\n\n\nCharles relates an incident of a slave named Sambo who thought himself\nvery smart and who courted the favor of the master. The neighboring\nslaves screamed so loudly while being whipped that Sambo told his master\nthat he knew how to make a contraption which, if a slave was put into\nwhile being whipped would prevent him from making a noise. The device\nwas made of two blocks of wood cut to fit the head and could be fastened\naround the neck tightly. When the head was put in, the upper and lower\nparts were clamped together around the neck so that the slave could not\nscream. The same effect as choking. The stomach of the victim was placed\nover a barrel which allowed freedom of movement. When the lash was\nadministered and the slave wiggled, the barrel moved.\n\n\nNow it so happened that Sambo was the first to be put into his own\ninvention for a whipping. The overseer applied the lash rather heavily,\nand Sambo was compelled to wiggle his body to relieve his feelings. In\nwiggling the barrel under his stomach rolled a bit straining Sambo's\nneck and breaking it. After Sambo died from his neck being broken the\nmaster discontinued the use of the device, as he saw the loss of\nproperty in the death of slaves.\n\n\nCharles was still a carriage driver when freedom came. He had\nopportunity to see and hear many things about the master's private life.\nWhen the news of the advance of the Union Army came, Mr. Hall carried\nhis money to a secluded spot and buried it in an iron pot so that the\nsoldiers who were confiscating all the property and money they could,\nwould not get his money. The slave owners were required to notify the\nslaves that they were free so Mr. Hall sent his son Sherard to the\ncabins to notify all the slaves to come into his presence and there he\nhad his son to tell them that they were free. The Union soldiers took\nmuch of the slave owners' property and gave to the slaves telling them\nthat if the owners' took the property back to write and tell them about\nit; the owners only laughed because they knew the slaves could not read\nnor write. After the soldiers had gone the timid and scared slaves gave\nup most of the land; some few however, fenced in a bit of land while the\nsoldiers remained in the vicinity and they managed to keep a little of\nthe land.\n\n\nMany of the slaves remained with the owners. There they worked for small\nmonthly wages and took whatever was left of cast off clothing and food\nand whatever the \"old missus\" gave them. A pair of old pants of the\nmaster was highly prized by them.\n\n\nCharles Coates was glad to be free. He had been well taken care of and\nlooked younger than 37 years of age at the close of slavery. He had not\nbeen married; had been put upon the block twice to be sold after\nbelonging to Mr. Hall. Each time he was offered for sale, his master\nwanted so much for him, and refusing to sell him on time payments, he\nwas always left on his master's hands. His master said \"being tall,\nhealthy and robust, he was well worth much money.\"\n\n\nAfter slavery, Charles was rated as a good worker. He at once began\nworking and saving his money and in a short time he had accumulated\n\"around $200.\"\n\n\nThe first sight of a certain young woman caused him to fall in love. He\nsays the love was mutual and after a courtship of three weeks they were\nmarried. The girl's mother told Charles that she had always been very\nfrail, but he did not know that she had consumption. Within three days\nafter they were married she died and her death caused much grief for\nCharles.\n\n\nHe was reluctant to bury her and wanted to continue to stand and look at\nher face. A white doctor and a school teacher whose names he does not\nremember, told him to put his wife's body in alcohol to preserve it and\nhe could look at it all the time. At that time white people who had\nplenty of money and wanted to see the faces of their deceased used this\nmethod.\n\n\nA glass casket was used and the dressed body of the deceased was placed\nin alcohol inside the casket. Another casket made of wood held the glass\ncasket and the whole was placed in a vault made of stone or brick. The\nwalls of the vault were left about four feet above the ground and a\nwindow and ledge were placed in front, so when the casket was placed\ninside of the vault the bereaved could lean upon the ledge and look in\nat the face of the deceased. The wooden casket was provided with a glass\ntop part of the way so that the face could easily be seen.\n\n\nAlthough the process of preserving the body in alcohol cost $160,\nCharles did not regret the expense saying, \"I had plenty of money at\nthat time.\"\n\n\nAfter the death of his wife, Charles left with his mother and father,\nHenrietta and Spencer Coates and went to Savannah, Georgia. He said they\nwere so glad to go, that they walked to within 30 miles of Savannah,\nwhen they saw a man driving a horse and wagon who picked them up and\ncarried them into Savannah. It was in that city that he met his present\nwife, Irene, and they were married about 1876.\n\n\nThere are nine grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren living and in\nMarch of 1936, when a party was given in honor of Father Coates' 108th\nbirthday, one of each of the four generations of his family were\npresent.\n\n\nThe party was given at the Clara White Mission, 615 West Ashley Street\nby Ertha M.M. White. Father Coates and his wife were very much honored\nand each spoke encouraging words to those present. On the occasion he\nsaid that the cause for his long life was due to living close to nature,\nrising early, going to bed early and not dissipating in any way.\n\n\nHe can \"shout\" (jumping about a foot and a half from the floor and\nknocking his heels together.) He does chores about his yard; looks years\nyounger than he really is and enjoys good health. His hair is partly\nwhite; his memory very good and his chief delight is talking about God\nand his goodness. He has preached the gospel in his humble way for a\nnumber of years, thereby gaining the name of \"Father\" Coates.",

        "text": "Immediately after slavery in the United States, the southern white\npeople found themselves without servants. Women who were accustomed to\nhaving a nurse, maid, cook and laundress found themselves without\nsufficient money to pay wages to all these. There was a great amount of\nwork to be done and the great problem confronting married women who had\nnot been taught to work and who thought it beneath their standing to\nsoil their hands, found it very difficult.\n\n\nThere were on the other hand many Negro women who needed work and young\ngirls who needed guidance and training.\n\n\nThe home and guidance of the aristocratic white people offered the best\nopportunity for the dependent un-schooled freed women; and it was in\nthis kind of home that the ex-slave child of this story was reared.\n\n\nIrene Coates of 2015 Windle Street, Jacksonville, Florida, was born in\nGeorgia about 1859. She was close to six years of age when freedom was\ndeclared.\n\n\nShe was one among the many Negro children who had the advantage of\nliving under the direct supervision of kind whites and receiving the\ncare which could only be excelled by an educated mother.\n\n\nJimmie and Lou Bedell were the names of the man and wife who saw the\nneed of having a Negro girl come into their home as one in the family\nand at the same time be assured of a good and efficient servant in years\nto come.\n\n\nWhen Irene was old enough, she became the nurse of the Bedell baby and\nwhen the family left Savannah, Georgia to come to Jacksonville, they\nbrought Irene with them.\n\n\nAlthough Irene was just about six years old when the Civil War ended,\nshe has vivid recollection of happenings during slavery. Some of the\nincidents which happened were told her by her slave associates after\nslavery ended and some of them she remembers herself.\n\n\nTwo incidents which she considers caused respect for slaves by their\nmasters and finally the Emancipation by Abraham Lincoln she tells in\nthis order.\n\n\nThe first event tells of a young, strong healthy Negro woman who\nknew her work and did it well. \"She would grab up two bags of\nguana (fertilizer) and tote 'em at one time,\" said Irene, and was never\nfound shirking her work. The overseer on the plantation, was very hard\non the slaves and practiced striking them across the back with a whip\nwhen he wanted to spur them on to do more work.\n\n\nIrene says, one day a crowd of women were hoeing in the field and the\noverseer rode along and struck one of the women across the back with the\nwhip, and the one nearest her spoke and said that if he ever struck her\nlike that, it would be the day he or she would die. The overseer heard\nthe remark and the first opportunity he got, he rode by the woman and\nstruck her with the whip and started to ride on. The woman was hoeing at\nthe time, she whirled around, struck the overseer on his head with the\nhoe, knocking him from his horse, she then pounced upon him and chopped\nhis head off. She went mad for a few seconds and proceeded to chop and\nmutilate his body; that done to her satisfaction, she then killed his\nhorse. She then calmly went to tell the master of the murder, saying\n\"I've done killed de overseer,\" the master replied--\"Do you mean to say\nyou've killed the overseer?\" she answered yes, and that she had killed\nthe horse also. Without hesitating, the master pointing to one of his\nsmall cabins on the plantation said--\"You see that house over there?\"\nshe answered yes--at the same time looking--\"Well\" said he, \"take all\nyour belongings and move into that house and you are free from this day\nand if the mistress wants you to do anything for her, do it if you want\nto.\" Irene related with much warmth the effect that incident had upon\nthe future treatment of the slaves.\n\n\nThe other incident occured in Virginia. It was upon an occasion when\nMrs. Abraham Lincoln was visiting in Richmond. A woman slaveowner had\none of her slaves whipped in the presence of Mrs. Lincoln. It was\neasily noticed that the woman was an expectant mother. Mrs. Lincoln was\nhorrified at the situation and expressed herself as being so, saying\nthat she was going to tell the President as soon as she returned to the\nWhite House. Whether this incident had any bearing upon Mr. Lincoln's\nactions or not, those slaves who were present and Irene says that they\nall believed it to be the beginning of the President's activities to end\nslavery.\n\n\nBesides these incidents, Irene remembers that women who were not strong\nand robust were given such work as sewing, weaving and minding babies.\nThe cloth from which the Sunday clothes of the slaves was made was\ncalled _ausenburg_ and the slave women were very proud of this. The\nolder women were required to do most of the weaving of cloth and making\nshirts for the male slaves.\n\n\nWhen an old woman who had been sick, regained her strength, she was sent\nto the fields the same as the younger ones. The ones who could cook and\ntickle the palates of her mistress and master were highly prized and\nwere seldon if ever offered for sale at the auction block.\n\n\nThe slaves were given fat meat and bread made of husk of corn and wheat.\nThis caused them to steal food and when caught they were severely\nwhipped.\n\n\nIrene recalls the practice of blowing a horn whenever a sudden rain\ncame. The overseer had a certain Negro to blow three times and if\nshelter could be found, the slaves were expected to seek it until the\nrain ceased.\n\n\nThe master had sheds built at intervals on the plantation. These\naccomodated a goodly number; if no shed was available the slaves stood\nunder trees. If neither was handy and the slaves got wet, they could not\ngo to the cabins to change clothes for fear of losing time from work.\nThis was often the case; she says that slaves were more neglected than\nthe cattle.\n\n\nAnother custom which impressed the child-mind of Irene was the tieing of\nslaves by their thumbs to a tree limb and whipping them. Women and young\ngirls were treated the same as were men.\n\n\nAfter the Bedells took Irene to live in their home they traveled a deal.\nAfter bringing her to Jacksonville, when Jacksonville was only a small\nport, they then went to Camden County, Georgia.\n\n\nIrene married while in Georgia and came back to Jacksonville with her\nhusband Charles, the year of the earthquake at Charleston, South\nCarolina, about 1888.\n\n\nIrene and Charles Coates have lived in Jacksonville since that time. She\nrelates many tales of happenings during the time that this city grew\nfrom a town of about four acres to its present status.\n\n\nIrene is the mother of five children. She has nine grandchildren and\neight great-grandchildren. Her health is fair, but her eyesight is poor.\nIt is her delight to entertain visitors and is conversant upon matters\npertaining to slavery and reconstruction days.",

        "text": "Interesting tales of the changes that came to the section of Florida\nthat is situated along the Putnam-Clay County lines are told by Neil\nCoker, old former slave who lives two miles south of McRae on the road\nGrandin.\n\n\nCoker is the son of a slave mother and a half-Negro. His father, he\nstates, was Senator John Wall, who held a seat in the senate for sixteen\nyears. He was born in Virginia, and received his family name from an old\nfamily bearing the same in that state. He was born, as nearly as he can\nremember, about 1857.\n\n\nOne of Coker's first reminiscences is of the road on which he still\nlives. During his childhood it was known as the 'Bellamy Road,' so\ncalled because it was built, some 132 years ago, by a man of that name\nwho hailed from West Florida.\n\n\nThe 'Bellamy Road' was at one time the main route of traffic between\nTallahassee and St. Augustine. (Interestingly enough, the road is at\nleast 30 miles southwest of St. Augustine where it passes through\nGrandin; the reason for cutting it in such a wide circle, Coker says was\nbecause of the ferocity of the Seminoles in the swamps north and west of\nSt. Augustine.)\n\n\nWagons, carriages and stages passed along this road in the days before\nthe War Between the States, Coker says. In addition to these he claims\nto have seen many travellers by foot, and not infrequently furtive\nescaped slaves, the latter usually under cover of an appropriate\nbackground of darkness.\n\n\nThe road again came into considerable use during the late days of the\nWar. It was during these days that the Federal troops, both whites and\nNegroes, passed in seemingly endless procession on their way to or from\nencounters. On one occasion the former slave recounts having seen a\nprocession of soldiers that took nearly two days to pass; they travelled\non horse and afoot.\n\n\nSeveral amusing incidents are related by the ex-slave of the events of\nthis period. Dozens of the Negro soldiers, he says, discarded their\nuniforms for the gaudier clothing that had belonged to their masters in\nformer days, and could be identified as soldiers as they passed only\nwith difficulty. Others would pause on their trip at some plantation,\nascertain the name of the 'meanest' overseer on the place, then tie him\nbackward on a horse and force him to accompany them. Particularly\nretributive were the punishments visited upon Messrs. Mays and\nPrevatt--generally recognized as the most vicious slave drivers of the\nsection.\n\n\nBellamy, Coker says built the road with slave labor and as an\ninvestment, realizing much money on tolls on it for many years. A\nremarkable feature of the road is that despite its age and the fact that\nCounty authorities have permitted its former good grading to deterierate\nto an almost impassable sand at some seasons, there is no mistaking the\nfact that this was once a major thoroughfare.\n\n\nThe region that stretches from Green Cove Springs in the Northeast to\nGrandin in the Southwest, the former slave claims, was once dotted with\nlakes, creeks, and even a river; few of the lakes and none of the other\nbodies still exist, however.\n\n\nAmong the more notable of the bodies of water was a stream--he does not\nnow remember its name--that ran for about 20 miles in an easterly\ndirection from Starke. This stream was one of the fastest that the\nformer slave can remember having seen in Florida; its power was utilised\nfor the turning of a power mill which he believes ground corn or other\ngrain. The falls in the river that turned the water mill, he states, was\nat least five or six feet high, and at one point under the Falls a man\nnamed (or possibly nicknamed) \"Yankee\" operated a sawmill. Coker\nbelieves that this mill, too, derived its power from the little stream.\nHe says that the stream has been extinct since he reached manhood. It\nended in 'Scrub Pond,' beyond Grandin and Starke.\n\n\nSome of the names of the old lakes of the section were these: \"Brooklyn\nLake; Magnolia Lake; Soldier Pond (near Keystone); Half-Moon Pond, near\nPutnam Hall; Hick's Lake\" and others. On one of them was the large grist\nmill of Dr. McCray; Coker suggests that this might be the origin of the\ntown of McRae of the present period.\n\n\nTo add to its natural water facilities, Coker points out, Bradford\nCounty also had a canal. This canal ran from the interior of the county\nto the St. John's River near Green Cove Springs, and with Mandarin on\nthe other side of the river still a major shipping point, the canal\nhandled much of the commerce of Bradford and Clay Counties.\n\n\nCoker recalls vividly the Indians of the area in the days before 1870.\nThese, he claims to have been friendly, but reserved, fellows; he does\nnot recall any of the Indian women.\n\n\nNegro slaves from the region around St. Augustine and what is now\nHastings used to escape and use Bellamy's Road on their way to the area\nabout Micanopy. It was considered equivalent to freedom to reach that\nsection, with its friendly Indians and impenetrable forests and swamps.\n\n\nThe little town of Melrose probably had the most unusual name of all the\nstrange ones prevalent at the time. It was call, very simply,\n\"Shake-Rag.\" Coker makes no effort to explain the appelation.",

Kindness and consideration for\nhis slaves, made them love him.\n\n\nReverend Davis was rather young during his years in slavery but when he\nwas asked to tell something about the days of slavery, replied: \"I\nremember many things about slavery, but know they will not come to me\nnow; anyway, I'll tell what I can think of.\"\n\n\nHe tells of the use of iron pots, fireplaces with rods used to hold the\npots above the fire for cooking peas, rice, vegetables, meats, etc.; the\nhome-made coffee from meal, spring and well water, tanning rawhide for\nleather, spinning of thread from cotton and the weaving looms.\n\n\n\"There was no difference,\" he states, \"in the treatment of men and women\nfor work; my parents worked very hard and women did some jobs that we\nwould think them crazy for trying now; why my mother helped build a\nrailroad before she was married to my father. My mother's first husband\nwas sold away from her; shucks, some of the masters didn't care how they\ntreated husbands, wives, parents and children; any of them might be\nseparated from the other. A good price for a 'nigger' was $1500 on down\nand if one was what was called a stallion (healthy), able to get plenty\nchildren he would bring about $2500.\n\n\n\"They had what was called legal money--I did have some of it but guess\nit was burned when I lost my house by fire a few years ago.\n\n\n\"Now, my master had three boys and two girls; his wife, Elizabeth, was\nabout like the ordinary missus; Master Davis was good, but positive; he\ndidn't allow other whites to bother his slaves.\n\n\n\"When the war came, his two boys went first, finally Master Davis went;\nhe and one son never returned.\n\n\n\"The Yankees killed cows, etc., as they went along but did not destroy\nany property 'round where I was.\n\n\n\"We had preachers and doctors, but no schools; the white preachers told\nus to obey and would read the Bible (which we could not understand) and\ntold us not to steal eggs. Most of the doctors used herbs from the woods\nand \"Aunt Jane\" and \"Uncle Bob\" were known for using \"Samson's Snake\nRoot,\" \"Devil's shoe-string\" for stomach troubles and \"low-bud Myrtle\"\nfor fevers; that's good now, chile, if you can get it.\n\n\n\"The 'nigger' didn't have a chance to git in politics during slavery,\nbut after Emancipation, he went immediately into the Republican Party; a\nfew into the Democratic Party; there were many other parties, too.\n\n\n\"The religions were Methodist and Baptist; my master was Baptist and\nthat's what I am; we could attend church but dare not try to get any\neducation, less we punished with straps.\n\n\n\"There are many things I remember just like it was yesterday--the\ngeneral punishment was with straps--some of the slaves suffered terribly\non the plantations; if the master was poor and had few slaves he was\nmean--the more wealthy or more slaves he had, the better he was. In some\ncases it was the general law that made some of the masters as they were;\nas, the law required them to have an overseer or foreman (he was called\n\"boss man\") by the 'niggers' and usually came from the lower or poorer\nclasses of whites; he didn't like 'niggers' usually, and took authority\nto do as he pleased with them at times. Some plantations preferred and\ndid have 'nigger riders' that were next to the overseer or foreman, but\nthey were liked better than the foreman and in many instances were\ntreated like foremen but the law would not let them be called \"foremen.\"\nSome of the masters stood between the 'nigger riders' and foremen and\nsome cases, the 'nigger' was really boss.\n\n\n\"The punishments, as I said were cruel--some masters would hang the\nslaves up by both thumbs so that their toes just touched the floor,\nwomen and men, alike. Many slaves ran away; others were forced by their\ntreatment to do all kinds of mean things. Some slaves would dig deep\nholes along the route of the \"Patrollers\" and their horses would fall in\nsometimes breaking the leg of the horse, arm or leg of the rider; some\nslaves took advantage of the protection their masters would give them\nwith the overseer or other plantation owners, would do their devilment\nand \"fly\" to their masters who did not allow a man from another\nplantation to bother his slaves. I have known pregnant women to go ten\nmiles to help do some devilment. My mother was a very strong woman (as I\ntold you she helped build a railroad), and felt that she could whip any\nordinary man, would not get a passport unless she felt like it; once\nwhen caught on another plantation without a passport, she had all of us\nwith her, made all of the children run, but wouldn't run\nherself--somehow she went upstream, one of the men's horse's legs was\nbroken and she told him \"come and get me\" but she knew the master\nallowed no one to come on his place to punish his slaves.\n\n\n\"My father was a blacksmith and made the chains used for stocks, (like\nhandcuffs), used on legs and hands. The slaves were forced to lay flat\non their backs and were chained down to the board made for that purpose;\nthey were left there for hours, sometimes through rain and cold; he\nmight 'holler' and groan but that did not always get him released.\n\n\n\"The Race became badly mixed then; some Negro women were forced into\nassociation, some were beaten almost to death because they refused. The\nNegro men dare not bother or even speak to some of their women.\n\n\n\"In one instance an owner of a plantation threatened a Negro rider's\nsweetheart; she told him and he went crying to this owner who in turned\nthreatened him and probably did hit the woman; straight to his master\nthis sweetheart went and when he finished his story, his master\nimmediately took his team and drove to the other plantation--drove so\nfast that one of his horses' dropped dead; when the owner came out he\nlevelled his double-barrel shotgun at him and shot him dead. No, suh;\nsome masters did not allow you to bother their slaves.\n\n\n\"A peculiar case was that of Old Jim who lived on another plantation was\nleft to look out for the fires and do other chores around the house\nwhile 'marster' was at war. A bad rumor spread, and do you know those\nmean devils, overseers of nearby plantations came out and got her dug a\ndeep hole, and despite her cries, buried her up to her neck--nothing was\nleft out but her head and hair. A crowd of young 'nigger boys' saw it\nall and I was one among the crowd that helped dig her out.\n\n\n\"Oh, there's a lots more I know but just cant get it together. My\nmother's name was Caroline and my father Patrick; all took the name of\nDavis from our master. There were thirteen children--I am the only one\nalive.\"\n\n\nMr. Davis appears well preserved for his age; he has most of his teeth\nand is slightly gray; his health seems to be good, although he is a\ncripple and uses a cane for walking always; this condition he believes\nis the result of an attack of rheumatism.\n\n\nHe is a preacher and has pastored in Alabama, Texas and Florida. He has\nhad several years of training in public schools and under ministers.\n\n\nHe has lived in Jacksonville since 1918 coming here from Waycross,\nGeorgia.\n\n\nHe was married for the first and only time during his 62 years of life\nto Mrs. Lizzie P. Brown, November 19, 1935. There are no children. He\ngives no reason for remaining single, but his reason for marrying was\n\"to give some lady the privilege and see how it feels to be called\nhusband.\"",

        "age": "14",
        "address": "Florida",
        "state": "Florida",
        "text": "In South Jacksonville, on the Spring Glen Road lives Douglas Dorsey, an\nex-slave, born in Suwannee County, Florida in 1851, fourteen years prior\nto freedom. His parents Charlie and Anna Dorsey were natives of Maryland\nand free people. In those days, Dorsey relates there were people known\nas \"Nigger Traders\" who used any subterfuge to catch Negroes and sell\nthem into slavery. There was one Jeff Davis who was known as a\nprofessional \"Nigger Trader,\" his slave boat docked in the slip at\nMaryland and Jeff Davis and his henchmen went out looking for their\nvictims. Unfortunately, his mother Anna and his father were caught one\nnight and were bound and gagged and taken to Jeff Davis' boat which was\nwaiting in the harbor, and there they were put into stocks. The boat\nstayed in port until it was loaded with Negroes, then sailed for Florida\nwhere Davis disposed of his human cargo.\n\n\nDouglas Dorsey's parents were sold to Colonel Louis Matair, who had a\nlarge plantation that was cultivated by 85 slaves. Colonel Matair's\nhouse was of the pretentious southern colonial type which was quite\nprevalent during that period. The colonel had won his title because of\nhis participation in the Indian War in Florida. He was the typical\nwealthy southern gentleman, and was very kind to his slaves. His wife,\nhowever was just the opposite. She was exceedingly mean and could easily\nbe termed a tyrant.\n\n\nThere were several children in the Matair family and their home and\nplantation were located in Suwannee County, Florida.\n\n\nDouglas' parents were assigned to their tasks, his mother was house-maid\nand his father was the mechanic, having learned this trade in Maryland\nas a free man. Charlie and Anna had several children and Douglas was\namong them. When he became large enough he was kept in the Matair home\nto build fires, assist in serving meals and other chores.\n\n\nMrs. Matair being a very cruel woman, would whip the slaves herself for\nany misdemeanor. Dorsey recalls an incident that is hard to obliterate\nfrom his mind, it is as follows: Dorsey's mother was called by Mrs.\nMatair, not hearing her, she continued with her duties, suddenly Mrs.\nMatair burst out in a frenzy of anger over the woman not answering. Anna\nexplained that she did not hear her call, thereupon Mrs. Matair seized a\nlarge butcher knife and struck at Anna, attempting to ward off the blow,\nAnna received a long gash on the arm that laid her up for for some\ntime. Young Douglas was a witness to this brutal treatment of his mother\nand he at that moment made up his mind to kill his mistress. He intended\nto put strychnine that was used to kill rats into her coffee that he\nusually served her. Fortunately freedom came and saved him of this act\nwhich would have resulted in his death.\n\n\nHe relates another incident in regard to his mistress as follows: To his\nmother and father was born a little baby boy, whose complexion was\nrather light. Mrs. Matair at once began accusing Colonel Matair as being\nthe father of the child. Naturally the colonel denied, but Mrs. Matair\nkept harassing him about it until he finally agreed to his wife's desire\nand sold the child. It was taken from its mother's breast at the age of\neight months and auctioned off on the first day of January to the\nhighest bidder. The child was bought by a Captain Ross and taken across\nthe Suwannee River into Hamilton County. Twenty years later he was\nlocated by his family, he was a grown man, married and farming.\n\n\nYoung Douglas had the task each morning of carrying the Matair\nchildren's books to school. Willie, a boy of eight would teach Douglas\nwhat he learned in school, finally Douglas learned the alphabet and\nnumbers. In some way Mrs. Matair learned that Douglas was learning to\nread and write. One morning after breakfast she called her son Willie to\nthe dining room where she was seated and then sent for Douglas to come\nthere too. She then took a quill pen the kind used at that time, and\nbegan writing the alphabet and numerals as far as ten. Holding the paper\nup to Douglas, she asked him if he knew what they were; he proudly\nanswered in the affirmative, not suspecting anything. She then asked him\nto name the letters and numerals, which he did, she then asked him to\nwrite them, which he did. When he reached the number ten, very proud of\nhis learning, she struck him a heavy blow across the face, saying to him\n\"If I ever catch you making another figure anywhere I'll cut off your\nright arm.\" Naturally Douglas and also her son Willie were much\nsurprised as each thought what had been done was quite an achievement.\nShe then called Mariah, the cook to bring a rope and tying the two of\nthem to the old colonial post on the front porch, she took a chair and\nsat between the two, whipping them on their naked backs for such a time,\nthat for two weeks their clothes stuck to their backs on the lacerated\nflesh.\n\n\nTo ease the soreness, Willie would steal grease from the house and\ntogether they would slip into the barn and grease each other's backs.\n\n\nAs to plantation life, Dorsey said that the slaves lived in quarters\nespecially built for them on the plantation. They would leave for the\nfields at \"sun up\" and remain until \"sun-down,\" stopping only for a meal\nwhich they took along with them.\n\n\nInstead of having an overseer they had what was called a \"driver\" by\nthe name of Januray[TR:?]. His duties were to get the slaves together in\nthe morning and see that they went to the fields and assigned them to\ntheir tasks. He worked as the other slaves, though, he had more\npriveliges. He would stop work at any time he pleased and go around to\ninspect the work of the others, and thus rest himself. Most of the\norders from the master were issued to him. The crops consisted of\ncotton, corn, cane and peas, which was raised in abundance.\n\n\nWhen the slaves left the fields, they returned to their cabins and after\npreparing and eating of their evening meal they gathered around a cabin\nto sing and moan songs seasoned with African melody. Then to the tune of\nan old fiddle they danced a dance called the \"Green Corn Dance\" and \"Cut\nthe Pigeon wing.\" Sometimes the young men on the plantation would slip\naway to visit a girl on another plantation. If they were caught by the\n\"Patrols\" while on these visits they would be lashed on the bare backs\nas a penalty for this offense.\n\n\nA whipping post was used for this purpose. As soon as one slave was\nwhipped, he was given the whip to whip his brother slave. Very often the\nlashes would bring blood very soon from the already lacerated skin, but\nthis did not stop the lashing until one had received their due number of\nlashes.\n\n\nOccasionally the slaves were ordered to church to hear a white\nminister, they were seated in the front pews of the master's church,\nwhile the whites sat in the rear. The minister's admonition to them to\nhonor their masters and mistresses, and to have no other God but them,\nas \"we cannot see the other God, but you can see your master and\nmistress.\" After the services the driver's wife who could read and write\na little would tell them that what the minister said \"was all lies.\"\n\n\nDouglas says that he will never forget when he was a lad 14 years of\nage, when one evening he was told to go and tell the driver to have all\nthe slaves come up to the house; soon the entire host of about 85 slaves\nwere gathered there all sitting around on stumps, some standing. The\ncolonel's son was visibly moved as he told them they were free. Saying\nthey could go anywhere they wanted to for he had no more to do with\nthem, or that they could remain with him and have half of what was\nraised on the plantation.\n\n\nThe slaves were happy at this news, as they had hardly been aware that\nthere had been a war going on. None of them accepted the offer of the\ncolonel to remain, as they were only too glad to leaver the cruelties of\nthe Matair plantation.\n\n\nDorsey's father got a job with Judge Carraway of Suwannee where he\nworked for one year. He later homesteaded 40 acres of land that he\nreceived from the government and began farming. Dorsey's father died in\nSuwannee County, Florida when Douglas was a young man and then he and\nhis mother moved to Arlington, Florida. His mother died several years\nago at a ripe old age.\n\n\nDouglas Dorsey, aged but with a clear mind lives with his daughter in\nSpring Glen.",

In 1937, at the age of 92,\nAmbrose Douglass welcomed his 38th child into the world.\n\n\nThe near-centenarian lives near Brooksville, in Hernando County, on a\nrun-down farm that he no longer attempts to tend now that most of his 38\nchildren have deserted the farm for the more lucrative employment of the\ncities of the phosphate camps.\n\n\nDouglass was born free in Detroit in 1845. His parents returned South to\nvisit relatives still in slavery, and were soon reenslaved themselves,\nwith their children. Ambrose was one of these.\n\n\nFor 21 years he remained in slavery; sometimes at the plantation of his\noriginal master in North Carolina, sometimes in other sections after he\nhad been sold to different masters.\n\n\n\"Yassuh, I been sold a lot of times\", the old man states. \"Our master\ndidn't believe in keeping a house, a horse or a darky after he had a\nchance to make some money on him. Mostly, though, I was sold when I cut\nup\".\n\n\n\"I was a young man\", he continues, \"and didn't see why I should be\nanybody's slave. I'd run away every chance I got. Sometimes they near\nkilled me, but mostly they just sold me. I guess I was pretty husky, at\nthat.\"\n\n\n\"They never did get their money's worth out of me, though. I worked as\nlong as they stood over me, then I ran around with the gals or sneaked\noff to the woods. Sometimes they used to put dogs on me to get me back.\n\n\n\"When they finally sold me to a man up in Suwannee County--his name was\nHarris--I thought it would be the end of the world. We had heard about\nhim all the way up in Virginia. They said he beat you, starved you and\ntied you up when you didn't work, and killed you if you ran away.\n\n\n\"But I never had a better master. He never beat me, and always fed all\nof us. 'Course, we didn't get too much to eat; corn meal, a little piece\nof fat meat now and then, cabbages, greens, potatoes, and plenty of\nmolasses. When I worked up at 'the house' I et just what the master et;\nsometimes he would give it to me his-self. When he didn't, I et it\nanyway.\n\n\n\"He was so good, and I was so scared of him, till I didn't ever run away\nfrom his place\", Ambrose reminisces; \"I had somebody there that I liked,\nanyway. When he finally went to the war, he sold me back to a man in\nNorth Carolina, in Hornett County. But the war was near over then; I\nsoon was as free as I am now.\n\n\n\"I guess we musta celebrated 'Mancipation about twelve times in Hornett\nCounty. Every time a bunch of No'thern sojers would come through they\nwould tell us we was free and we'd begin celebratin'. Before we would\nget through somebody else would tell us to go back to work, and we would\ngo. Some of us wanted to jine up with the army, but didn't know who was\ngoin' to win and didn't take no chances.\n\n\n\"I was 21 when freedom finally came, and that time I didn't take no\nchances on 'em taking it back again. I lit out for Florida and wound up\nin Madison County. I had a nice time there; I got married, got a plenty\nof work, and made me a little money. I fixed houses, built 'em, worked\naround the yards, and did everything. My first child was already born; I\ndidn't know there was goin' to be 37 more, though. I guess I would have\nstopped right there....\n\n\n\"I stayed in Madison County until they started to working concrete rock\ndown here. I heard about it and thought that would be a good way for me\nto feed all them two dozen children I had. So I came down this side.\nThat was about 20 years ago.\n\n\n\"I got married again after I got here; right soon after. My wife now is\n30 years old; we already had 13 children together. (His wife is a\nslight, girlish-looking woman; she says she was 13 when she married\nDouglass, had her first child that year. Eleven of her thirteen are\nstill living.)\n\n\n\"Yossuh, I ain't long stopped work. I worked here in the phosphate mine\nuntil last year, when they started to paying pensions. I thought I\nwould get one, but all I got was some PWA work, and this year they told\nme I was too old for that. I told 'em I wasn't but 91, but they didn't\ngive nothin' else.

Frost\nTampa, Florida\nMay 19, 1937\n\n\n\"MAMA DUCK\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Who is the oldest person, white or colored, that you know of in Tampa?\"\n\n\n\"See Mama Duck,\" the grinning Negro elevator boy told me. \"She bout a\nhunnert years old.\"\n\n\nSo down into the \"scrub\" I went and found the old woman hustling about\nfrom washpot to pump. \"I'm mighty busy now, cookin breakfast,\" she said,\n\"but if you come back in bout an hour I'll tell you what I can bout old\ntimes in Tampa.\"\n\n\nOn the return visit, her skinny dog met me with elaborate demonstrations\nof welcome.\n\n\n\"Guan way fum here Spot. Dat gemmen ain gwine feed you nothin. You keep\nyour dirty paws offen his clothes.\"\n\n\nMama duck sat down on a rickety box, motioning me to another one on the\nshaky old porch. \"Take keer you doan fall thoo dat old floor,\" she\ncautioned. \"It's bout ready to fall to pieces, but I way behind in the\nrent, so I kaint ask em to have it fixed.\"\n\n\n\"I see you have no glass in the windows--doesn't it get you wet when it\nrains?\"\n\n\n\"Not me. I gits over on de other side of de room. It didn't have no door\nneither when I moved in. De young folks frum here useta use it for a\ncourtin-house.\"\n\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\n\"Courtin-house. Dey kept a-comin after I moved in, an I had to shoo em\naway. Dat young rascal comin yonder--he one of em. I clare to\ngoodness--\" and Mama Duck raised her voice for the trespasser's benefit,\n\"I wisht I had me a fence to keep folks outa my yard.\"\n\n\n\"Qua-a-ck, quack, quack,\" the young Negro mocked, and passed on\ngrinning.\n\n\n\"Dat doan worry me none; I doan let _nothin_ worry me. Worry makes folks\ngray-headed.\" She scratched her head where three gray braids, about the\nlength and thickness of a flapper's eyebrow, stuck out at odd angles.\n\n\n\"I sho got plenty chancet to worry ifen I wants to,\" she mused, as she\nsipped water from a fruit-jar foul with fingermarks. \"Relief folks got\nme on dey black list. Dey won't give me rations--dey give rations to\nyoung folks whas workin, but won't give me nary a mouthful.\"\n\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\n\"Well, dey wanted me to go to de poor house. I was willin to go, but I\nwanted to take my trunk along an dey wouldn't let me. I got some things\nin dere I been havin nigh onta a hunnert years. Got my old blue-back\nWebster, onliest book I ever had, scusin my Bible. Think I wanna throw\ndat stuff away? No-o, suh!\" Mama Duck pushed the dog away from a\ncracked pitcher on the floor and refilled her fruit-jar. \"So day black\nlist me, cause I won't kiss dey feets. I ain kissin _nobody's_\nfeets--wouldn't kiss my own mammy's.\"\n\n\n\"Well, we'd all do lots of things for our mothers that we wouldn't do\nfor anyone else.\"\n\n\n\"Maybe you would, but not me. My mammy put me in a hickry basket when I\nwas a day an a half old, with nothin on but my belly band an diaper.\nTook me down in de cotton patch an sot me on a stump in de bilin sun.\"\n\n\n\"What in the world did she do that for?\"\n\n\n\"Cause I was black. All de other younguns was bright. My granmammy done\nhear me bawlin an go fotch me to my mammy's house. 'Dat you mammy?' she\nask, sweet as pie, when granmammy pound on de door.\n\n\n\"'Doan you never call me mammy no more,' granmammy say. 'Any woman\nwhat'd leave a poor lil mite like dis to perish to death ain fitten to\nbe no datter o' mine.'\n\n\n\"So granmammy took me to raise. I ain never seen my mammy sincet, an I\nain never wanted to.\"\n\n\n\"What did your father think of the way she treated you?\"\n\n\n\"Never knew who my daddy was, an I reckon she didn't either.\"\n\n\n\"Do you remember anything about the Civil War?\"\n\n\n\"What dat?\"\n\n\n\"The Civil War, when they set the slaves free.\"\n\n\n\"Oh, you mean de fust war. I reckon I does--had three chillern, boys,\nborned fore de war. When I was old enough to work I was taken to Pelman,\nJawja. Dey let me nust de chillern. Den I got married. We jus got\nmarried in de kitchen and went to our log house.\n\n\n\"I never got no beatins fum my master when I was a slave. But I seen\ncollored men on de Bradley plantation git frammed out plenty. De whippin\nboss was Joe Sylvester. He had pets amongst de women folks, an let some\nof em off light when they deserved good beatins.\"\n\n\n\"How did he punish his 'pets'?\"\n\n\n\"Sometimes he jus bop em crosst de ear wid a battlin stick.\"\n\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\n\"Battlin stick, like dis. You doan know what a battlin stick is? Well,\ndis here is one. Use it for washin clothes. You lift em outa de wash pot\nwid de battlin stick; den you lay em on de battlin block, dis here\nstump. Den you beat de dirt out wid de battlin stick.\"\n\n\n\"A stick like that would knock a horse down!\"\n\n\n\"Wan't nigh as bad as what some of de others got. Some of his pets\namongst de mens got it wusser dan de womens. He strap em crosst de sharp\nside of a barrel an give em a few right smart licks wid a bull whip.\"\n\n\n\"And what did he do to the bad ones?\"\n\n\n\"He make em cross dere hands, den he tie a rope roun dey wrists an throw\nit over a tree limb. Den he pull em up so dey toes jus touch de ground\nan smack em on da back an rump wid a heavy wooden paddle, fixed full o'\nholes. Den he make em lie down on de ground while he bust all dem\nblisters wid a raw-hide whip.\"\n\n\n\"Didn't that kill them?\"\n\n\n\"Some couldn't work for a day or two. Sometimes dey throw salt brine on\ndey backs, or smear on turputine to make it git well quicker.\"\n\n\n\"I suppose you're glad those days are over.\"\n\n\n\"Not me. I was a heap better off den as I is now. Allus had sumpun to\neat an a place to stay. No sich thing as gittin on a black list. Mighty\nhard on a pusson old as me not to git no rations an not have no reglar\njob.\"\n\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\n\"I doun know, zackly. Wait a minnit, I didn't show you my pitcher what\nwas in de paper, did I? I kaint read, but somebody say dey put how old I\nis under my pitcher in dat paper.\"\n\n\nMama Duck rummaged through a cigar box and brought out a page of a\nPittsburgh newspaper, dated in 1936. It was so badly worn that it was\nalmost illegible, but it showed a picture of Mama Duck and below it was\ngiven her age, 109.",

        "text": "Born in Brooks County, Georgia, 83 years ago on February 24th,\nWillie[TR:?] Dukes jovially declares that he is \"on the high road to\nlivin' a hund'ed years.\"\n\n\nHe was one of 40 slaves belonging to one John Dukes, who was only in\nmoderate circumstances. His parents were Amos and Mariah Dukes, both\nborn on this plantation, he thinks. As they were a healthy pair they\nwere required to work long hours in the fields, although the master was\nnot actually cruel to them.\n\n\nOn this plantation a variety of products was grown, cotton, corn,\npotatoes, peas, rice and sugar cane. Nothing was thrown away and the\nslaves had only coarse foods such as corn bread, collard greens, peas\nand occasionally a little rice or white bread. Even the potatoes were\nreserved for the white folk and \"house niggers.\"\n\n\nAs a child Willis was required to \"tote water and wood, help at milking\ntime and run errands.\" His clothing consisted of only a homespun shirt\nthat was made on the plantation. Nearly everything used was grown or\nmanufactured on the plantation. Candles were made in the big house by\nthe cook and a batch of slaves from the quarters, all of them being\nrequired to bring fat and tallow that had been saved for this purpose.\nThese candles were for the use of the master and mistress, as the slaves\nused fat lightwood torches for lighting purposes. Cotton was used for\nmaking clothes, and it was spun and woven into cloth by the slave women,\nthen stored in the commisary for future use. Broggan shoes were made of\ntanned leather held together by tacks made of maple wood. Lye soap was\nmade in large pots, cut into chunks and issued from the smoke house.\nPotash was secured from the ashes of burnt oak wood and allowed to set\nin a quantity of grease that had also been saved for the purpose, then\nboiled into soap.\n\n\nThe cotton was gathered in bags of bear grass and deposited in baskets\nwoven with strips of white oak that had been dried in the sun.\n\n\nWillis remembers the time when a slave on the plantation escaped and\nwent north to live. This man managed to communicate with his family\nsomehow, and it was whispered about that he was \"living very high\" and\nactually saving money with which to buy his family. He was even going to\nschool. This fired all the slaves with an ambition to go north and this\nmade them more than usually interested in the outcome of the war between\nthe states. He was too young to fully understand the meaning of freedom\nbut wanted very much to go away to some place where he could earn\nenough money to buy his mother a real silk dress. He confided this\ninformation to her and she was very proud of him but gave him a good\nspanking for fear he expressed this desire for freedom to his young\nmaster or mistress.\n\n\nPrayer meetings were very frequent during the days of the war and very\noften the slaves were called in from the fields and excused from their\nlabors so they could hold these prayer meetings, always praying God for\nthe safe return of their master.\n\n\nThe master did not return after the war and when the soldiers in blue\ncame through that section the frightened women were greatly dependent\nupon their slaves for protection and livelihood. Many of these black man\nchose loyalty to their dead masters to freedom and shouldered the burden\nof the support of their former mistresses cheerfully.\n\n\nAfter the war Willis' father was one of those to remain with his widowed\nmistress. Other members of his family left as soon as they were freed,\neven his wife. They thus remained separated until her death.\n\n\nWillis saw his first bedspring about 50 years ago and he still thinks a\nfeather mattress superior to the store-bought variety. He recalls a\nhumorous incident which occurred when he was a child and had been\nintroduced for the first time to the task of picking a goose.\n\n\nAfter demonstrating how it was done to a group of slave children, the\nperson in charge had gone about his way leaving them busily engaged in\npicking the goose. They had been told that the one gathering the most\nfeathers would receive a piece of money. Sometimes later the overseer\nreturned to find a dozen geese that had been stripped of all the\nfeathers. They had been told to pick only the pin feathers beneath the\nwings and about the bodies of the geese. Need we guess what happened to\nthe over ambitious children?\n\n\nHe had heard of ice long before he looked upon it and he only thought of\nit as another wild experiment. Why buy ice, when watermelons and butter\ncould be ley down into the well to keep cool?\n\n\nOne of Willis' happiest moments was when he earned enough money to buy\nhis first pair of patern leather shoes. To possess a paid of store\nbought shoes had been his ambition since he was a child, when he had to\nshine the shoes of his master and those of the master's children.\n\n\nHe next owned a horse and buggy of which he was very proud. This\nincreased his popularity with the girls and bye and bye he was married\nto Mary, a girl with whom he had been reared. Nobody was surprised but\nMary, explained Mr. Dukes. \"Me and everybody else knowed us ud get\nmarried some day. We didn't jump over no broom neither. We was married\nlike white folks wid flowers and cake and everything.\"\n\n\nWillis Dukes has been in Florida for \"Lawd knows how long\" and prefers\nthis state to his home state. He still has a few relatives there but has\nnever returned since leaving so long ago.",

        "text": "Sam and Louise Everett, 86 and 90 years of age respectively, have\nweathered together some of the worst experiences of slavery, and as they\nlook back over the years, can relate these experiences as clearly as if\nthey had happened only yesterday.\n\n\nBoth were born near Norfolk, Virginia and sold as slaves several times\non nearby plantations. It was on the plantation of \"Big Jim\" McClain\nthat they met as slave-children and departed after Emancipation to live\nthe lives of free people.\n\n\nSam was the son of Peter and Betsy Everett, field hands who spent long\nback-breaking hours in the cotton fields and came home at nightfall to\ncultivate their small garden. They lived in constant fear that their\nmaster would confiscate most of their vegetables; he so often did.\n\n\nLouisa remembers little about her parents and thinks that she was sold\nat an early age to a separate master. Her name as nearly as she could\nremember was Norfolk Virginia. Everyone called her \"Nor.\" It was not\nuntil after she was freed and had sent her children to school that she\nchanged her name to Louisa.\n\n\nSam and Norfolk spent part of their childhood on the plantation of \"Big\nJim\" who was very cruel; often he would whip his slaves into\ninsensibility for minor offences. He sometimes hung them up by their\nthumbs whenever they were caught attempting to escape--\"er fer no reason\natall.\"\n\n\nOn this plantation were more than 100 slaves who were mated\nindiscriminately and without any regard for family unions. If their\nmaster thought that a certain man and woman might have strong, healthy\noffspring, he forced them to have sexual relation, even though they were\nmarried to other slaves. If there seemed to be any slight reluctance on\nthe part of either of the unfortunate ones \"Big Jim\" would make them\nconsummate this relationship in his presence. He used the same procedure\nif he thought a certain couple was not producing children fast enough.\nHe enjoyed these orgies very much and often entertained his friends in\nthis manner; quite often he and his guests would engage in these\ndebaucheries, choosing for themselves the prettiest of the young women.\nSometimes they forced the unhappy husbands and lovers of their victims\nto look on.\n\n\nLouisa and Sam were married in a very revolting manner. To quote the\nwoman:\n\n\n\"Marse Jim called me and Sam ter him and ordered Sam to pull off his\nshirt--that was all the McClain niggers wore--and he said to me: 'Nor,\ndo you think you can stand this big nigger?' He had that old bull whip\nflung acrost his shoulder, and Lawd, that man could hit so hard! So I\njes said 'yassur, I guess so,' and tried to hide my face so I couldn't\nsee Sam's nakedness, but he made me look at him anyhow.\"\n\n\n\"Well, he told us what we must git busy and do in his presence, and we\nhad to do it. After that we were considered man and wife. Me and Sam was\na healthy pair and had fine, big babies, so I never had another man\nforced on me, thank God. Sam was kind to me and I learnt to love him.\"\n\n\nLife on the McClain plantation was a steady grind of work from morning\nuntil night. Slaves had to rise in the dark of the morning at the\nringing of the \"Big House\" bell. After eating a hasty breakfast of fried\nfat pork and corn pone, they worked in the fields until the bell rang\nagain at noon; at which time they ate boiled vegetables, roasted sweet\npotatoes and black molasses. This food was cooked in iron pots which had\nlegs attached to their bottoms in order to keep them from resting\ndirectly on the fire. These utensils were either hung over a fire or set\natop a mound of hot coals. Biscuits were a luxury but whenever they had\nwhite bread it was cooked in another thick pan called a \"spider\". This\npan had a top which was covered with hot embers to insure the browning\nof the bread on top.\n\n\nSlave women had no time for their children. These were cared for by an\nold woman who called them twice a day and fed them \"pot likker\"\n(vegetable broth) and skimmed milk. Each child was provided with a\nwooden laddle which he dipped into a wooden trough and fed himself. The\nolder children fed those who were too young to hold a laddle.\n\n\nSo exacting was \"Big Jim\" that slaves were forced to work even when\nsick. Expectant mothers toiled in the fields until they felt their labor\npains. It was not uncommon for babies to be born in the fields.\n\n\nThere was little time for play on his plantation. Even the very small\nchildren were assigned tasks. They hunted hen's eggs, gathered poke\nberries for dyeing, shelled corn and drove the cows home in the evening.\nLittle girls knitted stockings.\n\n\nThere was no church on this plantation and itinerant ministers avoided\ngoing there because of the owner's cruelty. Very seldom were the slaves\nallowed to attend neighboring churches and still rarer were the\nopportunities to hold meetings among themselves. Often when they were in\nthe middle of a song or prayer they would be forced to halt and run to\nthe \"Big House.\" Woe to any slave who ignored the ringing of the bell\nthat summoned him to work and told him when he might \"knock off\" from\nhis labors.\n\n\nLouisa and Sam last heard the ringing of this bell in the fall of 1865.\nAll the slaves gathered in front of the \"Big House\" to be told that they\nwere free for the time being. They had heard whisperings of the War but\ndid not understand the meaning of it all. Now \"Big Jim\" stood weeping on\nthe piazza and cursing the fate that had been so cruel to him by robbing\nhim of all his \"niggers.\" He inquired if any wanted to remain until all\nthe crops were harvested and when no one consented to do so, he flew\ninto a rage; seizing his pistol, he began firing into the crowd of\nfrightened Negroes. Some were _killed_ outright and others were maimed\nfor life. Finally he was prevailed upon to stop. He then attempted to\ntake his own life. A few frightened slaves promised to remain with him\nanother year; this placated him. It was necessary for Union soldiers to\nmake another visit to the plantation before \"Big Jim\" would allow his\nformer slaves to depart.\n\n\nSam and Louisa moved to Boston, Georgia, where they sharecropped for\nseveral years; they later bought a small farm when their two sons became\nold enough to help. They continued to live on this homestead until a few\nyears ago, when their advancing ages made it necessary that they live\nwith the children. Both of the children had settled in Florida several\nyears previous and wanted their parents to come to them. They now live\nin Mulberry, Florida with the younger son. Both are pitifully infirm but\ncan still remember the horrors they experienced under very cruel owners.\nIt was with difficulty that they were prevailed upon to relate some of\nthe gruesome details recorded here.",

        "text": "Duncan Gaines, the son of George and Martha Gaines was born on a\nplantation in Virginia on March 12, 1853. He was one of four children,\nall fortunate enough to remain with their parents until maturity. They\nwere sold many times, but Duncan Gaines best remembers the master who\nwas known as \"old man Beever.\"\n\n\nOn this plantation were about 50 slaves, who toiled all day in the\ncotton and tobacco fields and came home at dusk to cook their meals of\ncorn pone, collards and sweet potatoes on the hearths of their one room\ncabins. Biscuits were baked on special occasions by placing hot coals\natop the iron tops of long legged frying pans called spiders, and the\npotatoes were roasted in the ashes, likewise the corn pone. Their\nmasters being more or less kind, there was pork, chicken, syrup and\nother foodstuffs that they were allowed to raise as their own on a small\nscale. This work was often done by the light of a torch at night as they\nhad little time of their own. In this way slaves earned money for small\nluxuries and the more ambitious sometimes saved enough money to buy\ntheir freedom, although this was not encouraged very much.\n\n\nThe early life of Duncan was carefree and happy. With the exception of\ncarrying water to the laborers and running errands, he had little to do.\nMost of the time of the slave children was spent in playing ball and\nwrestling and foraging the woods for berries and fruits and playing\ngames as other children. They were often joined in their play by the\nmaster's children, who taught them to read and write and fired Duncan\nwith the ambition to be free, so that he could \"wear a frill on his\ncolar and own a pair of shoes that did not have brass caps on the toes\"\nand require the application of fat to make them shine.\n\n\nWearing his shoes shined as explained above and a coarse homespun suit\ndyed with oak bark, indigo or poke berries, he went to church on Sunday\nafternoons after the whites had had their services and listened to\nsermons delivered by white ministers who taught obedience to their\nmasters. After the services, most of the slaves would remove their shoes\nand carry them in their hands, as they were unaccustomed to wearing\nshoes except in winter.\n\n\nThe women were given Saturday afternoons off to launder their clothes\nand prepare for Sunday's services. All slaves were required to appear on\nMonday mornings as clean as possible with their clothing mended and\nheads combed.\n\n\nLye soap was used both for laundering and bathing. It was made from\nfragments of fat meat and skins that were carefully saved for that\npurpose. Potash was secured from oak ashes. This mixture was allowed to\nset for a certain period of time, then cooked to a jelly-like\nconsistency. After cooling, the soap was cut into square bars and\n\"lowanced out\" (allowance) to the slaves according to the number in each\nfamily. Once Duncan was given a bar of \"sweet\" soap by his mistress for\ndoing a particularly nice piece of work of polishing the harness of her\nfavorite mare and so proud was he of the gift that he put it among his\nSunday clothes to make them smell sweet. It was the first piece of\ntoilet sopa that he had ever seen; and it caused quite a bit of envy\namong the other slave children.\n\n\nDuncan Gaines does not remember his grandparents but thinks they were\nboth living on some nearby plantation. His father was the plantation\nblacksmith and Duncan liked to look on as plowshares, single trees,\nhorse shoes, etc were turned out or sharpened. His mother was strong and\nhealthy, so she toiled all day in the fields. Duncan always listened for\nhis mother's return from the field, which was heraled by a song, no\nmatter how tired she was. She was very fond of her children and did not\nshare the attitude of many slave mother who thought of their children as\nbelonging solely to the masters. She lived in constant fear that \"old\nmarse Seever\" would meet with some adversity and be forced to sell them\nseparately. She always whispered to them about \"de war\" and fanned to a\nflame their desire to be free.\n\n\nAt that time Negro children listened to the tales of _Raw Head and\nBloody Bones_, various animal stories and such childish ditties as:\n\n\n  \"Little Boy, Little Boy who made your breeches?\n  Mamma cut 'em out and pappa sewed de stitches.\"\n\n\nChildren were told that babies were dug out of tree stumps and were\ngenerally made to \"shut up\" if they questioned their elders about such\nmatters.\n\n\nChildren with long or large heads were thought to be marked to become\n\"wise men.\" Everyone believed in ghosts and entertained all the\nsuperstitions that have been handed down to the present generation.\nThere was much talk of \"hoodooism\" and anyone ill for a long time\nwithout getting relief from herb medicines was thought to be \"fixed\" or\nsuffering from some sin that his father had committed.\n\n\nDuncan was 12 years of age when freedom was declared and remembers the\nhectic times which followed. He and other slave children attended\nschools provided by the Freedmen' Aid and other social organizations\nfostered by Northerners. Most of the instructors were whites sent to the\nSouth for that purpose.\n\n\nThe Gaines were industrious and soon owned a prosperous farm. They\nseldom had any money but had plenty of foodstuffs and clothing and a\nfairly comfortable home. All of the children secured enough learning to\nenable them to read and write, which was regarded as very unusual in\nthose days. Slaves had been taught that their brain was inferior to the\nwhites who owned them and for this reason, many parents refused to send\ntheir children to school, thinking it a waste of time and that too much\nlearning might cause some injury to the brain of their supposedly\nweak-minded children.\n\n\nOf the various changes, Duncan remembers very little, so gradual did\nthey occur in his section. Water was secured from the spring or well.\nPerishable foodstuffs were let down into the well to keep cool. Shoes\nwere made from leather tanned by setting in a solution of red oak bark\nand water; laundering was done in wooden tubs, made from barrels cut in\nhalves. Candles were used for lighting and were made from sheep and beef\ntallow. Lightwood torches were used by those not able to afford candles.\nStockings were knitted by the women during cold or rainy weather.\nWeaving and spinning done by special slave women who were too old to\nwork in the fields; others made the cloth into garments. Everything was\ndone by hand except the luxuries imported by the wealthy.\n\n\nDuncan Gaines is now a widower and fast becoming infirm. He looks upon\nthis \"new fangled\" age with bare tolerance and feels that the happiest\nage of mankind has passed with the discarding of the simple, old\nfashioned way of doing things.",

Now, I can' say right 'zackly how things\nwuz during slavery 'cause its been a long time ago but we had cotton and\ncorn fields and de hands plowed hard, picked cotton grabbled penders,\ngathered peas and done all the other hard work to be done on de\nplantations. I wuz not big 'nuff to do all of dem things but I seed\nplenty of it done.\n\n\n\"Dey made lye soap on de farms and used indigo from wood for dye. We\nniggers slept on hay piled on top of planks but de white folks had\nbetter beds.\n\n\n\"I don't 'member my grandparents but my mas was called Harriet Williams\nand my pa was called Henry Williams; dey wuz called Williams after my\nmaster. My mas and pa worked very hard and got some beatings but I don't\nknow what for. Dey wuz all kinds of money, five and ten dollar bills,\nand so on then, but I didn't ever see them with any.\n\n\n\"When war came along and Sherman came through the old people wuz very\nskeered on account of the white owners but there was no fighting close\nto me. My master's sons Leo and Fletcher joined the army and lots of de\nother masters went; de servants wuz sent along to wait on de young white\nmen. Guess you'd like to know if any were killed. 'I should smile,' two\nI know were killed.\n\n\n\"During those days for medicine, the old people used such things as\nbutterfly root and butterfly tea, sage tea, red oak bark,\nhippecat--something that grow--was used for fevers and bathing children.\nThey wuz white doctors and plenty of colored grannies.\n\n\n\"When de Yankees came they acted diffunt and was naturally better to\nservants than our masters had been; we colored folks done the best we\ncould but that was not so good right after freedom. Still it growed on\nand growed on getting better.\n\n\n\"Before freedom we always went to white churches on Sundays with passes\nbut they never mentioned God; they always told us to be \"good niggers\nand mind our missus and masters\".\n\n\n\"Judge Williams had ten or twelve heads of children but I can' 'member\nthe names of 'em now; his wife was called Mis' 'Manda and she was jes'\n'bout lak Marse Williams. I had 'bout eighteen head of boys and five\ngirls myself; dere was so many, I can' 'member all of dem.\"\n\n\nMr. Gantling was asked to relate some incidents that he could remember\nof the lives of slaves, and he continued:\n\n\n\"Well the horn would blow every morning for you to git up and go right\nto work; when the sun ris' if you were not in the field working, you\nwould be whipped with whips and leather strops. I 'member Aunt Beaty was\nbeat until she could hardly get along but I can' 'member what for but do\nyou know she had to work along till she got better. My ma had to work\npretty hard but my oldest sister, Judy, was too young to work much.\n\n\n\"A heap of de slaves would run away and hide in de woods to keep from\nworking so hard but the white folks to keep them from running away so\nthat they could not ketch 'em would put a chain around the neck which\nwould hang down the back and be fastened on to another 'round the waist\nand another 'round the feet so they could not run, still they had to\nwork and sleep in 'em, too; sometimes they would wear these chains for\nthree or four months.\n\n\n\"When a slave would die they had wooden boxes to put 'em in and dug\nholes and just put then in. A slave might go to a sister or brother's\nfuneral.\n\n\n\"My recollection is very bad and so much is forgotten, but I have seen\nslaves sold in droves like cows; they called 'em 'ruffigees,' and white\nmen wuz drivin' 'em like hogs and cows for sale. Mothers and fathers\nwere sold and parted from their chillun; they wuz sold to white people\nin diffunt states. I tell you chile, it was pitiful, but God did not let\nit last always. I have heard slaves morning and night pray for\ndeliverance. Some of 'em would stand up in de fields or bend over cotton\nand corn and pray out loud for God to help 'em and in time you see, He\ndid.\n\n\n\"They had whut you call \"pattyrollers\" who would catch you from home and\n'wear you out' and send you back to your master. If a master had slaves\nhe jes' could not rule (some of 'em wuz hard and jes' would not mind de\nboss), he would ask him if he wanted to go to another plantation and if\nhe said he did, then, he would give him a pass and that pass would read:\n\"Give this nigger hell.\" Of course whan the \"pattyrollers\" or other\nplantation boss would read the pass he would beat him nearly to death\nand send him back. Of course the nigger could not read and did not know\nwhat the pass said. You see, day did not 'low no nigger to have a book\nor piece of paper of any kind and you know dey wuz not go teach any of\n'em to read.\n\n\n\"De women had it hard too; women with little babies would have to go to\nwork in de mornings with the rest, come back, nurse their chillun and go\nback to the field, stay two or three hours then go back and eat dinner;\nafter dinner dey would have to go to de field and stay two or three more\nhours then go and nurse the chillun again, go back to the field and stay\ntill night. One or maybe two old women would stay in a big house and\nkeep all de chillun while their mothers worked in de fields.\n\n\n\"Now dey is a heap more I could tell maybe but I don't think of no more\nnow.\"\n\n\nMr. Gantling came to Florida to Jennings Plantation near Lake Park and\nstayed two years, then went to Everett's Plantation and stayed one year.\nFrom there he went to a place called High Hill and stayed two or three\nyears. He left there and went to Jasper, farmed and stayed until he\nmoved his family to Jacksonville. Here he worked on public works until\nhe started raising hogs and chickens which he continued up to about\nfourteen years ago. Now, he is too old to do anything but just \"sit\naround and talk and eat.\"\n\n\nHe lives with his daughter, Mrs. Minnie Holly and her husband, Mr. Dany\nHolly on Lee Street.\n\n\nMr. Gantling cannot read or write, but is very interesting.\n\n\nHe has been a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church for more\nthan fifty years.\n\n\nHe has a very good appetite and although has lost his teeth, he has\nnever worn a plate or had any dental work done.

        "text": "(Verbatim Interview with Arnold Gragston, 97-year-old ex-slave whose\nearly life was spent helping slaves to freedom across the Ohio River,\nwhile he, himself, remained in bondage. As he puts it, he guesses he\ncould be called a 'conductor' on the underground railway, \"only we didn't\ncall it that then. I don't know as we called it anything--we just knew\nthere was a lot of slaves always a-wantin' to get free, and I had to\nhelp 'em.\")\n\n\n\"Most of the slaves didn't know when they was born, but I did. You see,\nI was born on a Christmas mornin'--it was in 1840; I was a full grown\nman when I finally got my freedom.\"\n\n\n\"Before I got it, though, I helped a lot of others get theirs. Lawd only\nknows how many; might have been as much as two-three hundred. It was\n'way more than a hundred, I know.\n\n\n\"But that all came after I was a young man--'grown' enough to know a\npretty girl when I saw one, and to go chasing after her, too. I was born\non a plantation that b'longed to Mr. Jack Tabb in Mason County, just\nacross the river in Kentucky.\"\n\n\n\"Mr. Tabb was a pretty good man. He used to beat us, sure; but not\nnearly so much as others did, some of his own kin people, even. But he\nwas kinda funny sometimes; he used to have a special slave who didn't\nhave nothin' to do but teach the rest of us--we had about ten on the\nplantation, and a lot on the other plantations near us--how to read and\nwrite and figger. Mr. Tabb liked us to know how to figger. But sometimes\nwhen he would send for us and we would be a long time comin', he would\nask us where we had been. If we told him we had been learnin' to read,\nhe would near beat the daylights out of us--after gettin' somebody to\nteach us; I think he did some of that so that the other owners wouldn't\nsay he was spoilin' his slaves.\"\n\n\n\"He was funny about us marryin', too. He would let us go a-courtin' on\nthe other plantations near anytime we liked, if we were good, and if we\nfound somebody we wanted to marry, and she was on a plantation that\nb'longed to one of his kin folks or a friend, he would swap a slave so\nthat the husband and wife could be together. Sometimes, when he couldn't\ndo this, he would let a slave work all day on his plantation, and live\nwith his wife at night on her plantation. Some of the other owners was\nalways talking about his spoilin' us.\"\n\n\n\"He wasn't a Dimmacrat like the rest of 'em in the county; he belonged\nto the 'know-nothin' party' and he was a real leader in it. He used to\nalways be makin' speeches, and sometimes his best friends wouldn't be\nspeaking to him for days at a time.\"\n\n\n\"Mr. Tabb was always specially good to me. He used to let me go all\nabout--I guess he had to; couldn't get too much work out of me even when\nhe kept me right under his eyes. I learned fast, too, and I think he\nkinda liked that. He used to call Sandy Davis, the slave who taught me,\n'the smartest Nigger in Kentucky.'\n\n\n\"It was 'cause he used to let me go around in the day and night so much\nthat I came to be the one who carried the runnin' away slaves over the\nriver. It was funny the way I started it too.\"\n\n\n\"I didn't have no idea of ever gettin' mixed up in any sort of business\nlike that until one special night. I hadn't even thought of rowing\nacross the river myself.\"\n\n\n\"But one night I had gone on another plantation 'courtin,' and the old\nwoman whose house I went to told me she had a real pretty girl there who\nwanted to go across the river and would I take her? I was scared and\nbacked out in a hurry. But then I saw the girl, and she was such a\npretty little thing, brown-skinned and kinda rosy, and looking as scared\nas I was feelin', so it wasn't long before I was listenin' to the old\nwoman tell me when to take her and where to leave her on the other\nside.\"\n\n\n\"I didn't have nerve enough to do it that night, though, and I told them\nto wait for me until tomorrow night. All the next day I kept seeing\nMister Tabb laying a rawhide across my back, or shootin' me, and kept\nseeing that scared little brown girl back at the house, looking at me\nwith her big eyes and asking me if I wouldn't just row her across to\nRipley. Me and Mr. Tabb lost, and soon as dust settled that night, I was\nat the old lady's house.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know how I ever rowed the boat across the river the current\nwas strong and I was trembling. I couldn't see a thing there in the\ndark, but I felt that girl's eyes. We didn't dare to whisper, so I\ncouldn't tell her how sure I was that Mr. Tabb or some of the others\nowners would 'tear me up' when they found out what I had done. I just\nknew they would find out.\"\n\n\n\"I was worried, too, about where to put her out of the boat. I couldn't\nride her across the river all night, and I didn't know a thing about the\nother side. I had heard a lot about it from other slaves but I thought\nit was just about like Mason County, with slaves and masters, overseers\nand rawhides; and so, I just knew that if I pulled the boat up and went\nto asking people where to take her I would get a beating or get killed.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know whether it seemed like a long time or a short time,\nnow--it's so long ago; I know it was a long time rowing there in the\ncold and worryin'. But it was short, too, 'cause as soon as I did get on\nthe other side the big-eyed, brown-skin girl would be gone. Well, pretty\nsoon I saw a tall light and I remembered what the old lady had told me\nabout looking for that light and rowing to it. I did; and when I got up\nto it, two men reached down and grabbed her; I started tremblin' all\nover again, and prayin'. Then, one of the men took my arm and I just\nfelt down inside of me that the Lord had got ready for me. 'You hungry,\nBoy?' is what he asked me, and if he hadn't been holdin' me I think I\nwould have fell backward into the river.\"\n\n\n\"That was my first trip; it took me a long time to get over my scared\nfeelin', but I finally did, and I soon found myself goin' back across\nthe river, with two and three people, and sometimes a whole boatload. I\ngot so I used to make three and four trips a month.\n\n\n\"What did my passengers look like? I can't tell you any more about it\nthan you can, and you wasn't there. After that first girl--no, I never\ndid see her again--I never saw my passengers. I would have to be the\n\"black nights\" of the moon when I would carry them, and I would meet 'em\nout in the open or in a house without a single light. The only way I\nknew who they were was to ask them; \"What you say?\" And they would\nanswer, \"Menare.\" I don't know what that word meant--it came from the\nBible. I only know that that was the password I used, and all of them\nthat I took over told it to me before I took them.\n\n\n\"I guess you wonder what I did with them after I got them over the\nriver. Well, there in Ripley was a man named Mr. Rankins; I think the\nrest of his name was John. He had a regular station there on his place\nfor escaping slaves. You see, Ohio was a free state and once they got\nover the river from Kentucky or Virginia. Mr. Rankins could strut them\nall around town, and nobody would bother 'em. The only reason we used to\nland quietly at night was so that whoever brought 'em could go back for\nmore, and because we had to be careful that none of the owners had\nfollowed us. Every once in a while they would follow a boat and catch\ntheir slaves back. Sometimes they would shoot at whoever was trying to\nsave the poor devils.\n\n\n\"Mr. Rankins had a regular 'station' for the slaves. He had a big\nlighthouse in his yard, about thirty feet high and he kept it burnin'\nall night. It always meant freedom for slave if he could get to this\nlight.\n\n\n\"Sometimes Mr. Rankins would have twenty or thirty slaves that had run\naway on his place at the time. It must have cost him a whole lots to\nkeep them and feed 'em, but I think some of his friends helped him.\n\n\n\"Those who wanted to stay around that part of Ohio could stay, but\ndidn't many of 'em do it, because there was too much danger that you\nwould be walking along free one night, feel a hand over your mouth, and\nbe back across the river and in slavery again in the morning. And nobody\nin the world ever got a chance to know as much misery as a slave that\nhad escaped and been caught.\n\n\n\"So a whole lot of 'em went on North to other parts of Ohio, or to New\nYork, Chicago or Canada; Canada was popular then because all of the\nslaves thought it was the last gate before you got all the way _inside_\nof heaven. I don't think there was much chance for a slave to make a\nliving in Canada, but didn't many of 'em come back. They seem like they\nrather starve up there in the cold than to be back in slavery.\n\n\n\"The Army soon started taking a lot of 'em, too. They could enlist in\nthe Union Army and get good wages, more food than they ever had, and\nhave all the little gals wavin' at 'em when they passed. Them blue\nuniforms was a nice change, too.\n\n\n\"No, I never got anything from a single one of the people I carried over\nthe river to freedom. I didn't want anything; after had made a few trips\nI got to like it, and even though I could have been free any night\nmyself, I figgered I wasn't getting along so bad so I would stay on Mr.\nTabb's place and help the others get free. I did it for four years.\n\n\n\"I don't know to this day how he never knew what I was doing; I used to\ntake some awful chances, and he knew I must have been up to something; I\nwouldn't do much work in the day, would never be in my house at night,\nand when he would happen to visit the plantation where I had said I was\ngoin' I wouldn't be there. Sometimes I think he did know and wanted me\nto get the slaves away that way so he wouldn't have to cause hard\nfeelins' by freein 'em.\n\n\n\"I think Mr. Tabb used to talk a lot to Mr. John Fee; Mr. Fee was a man\nwho lived in Kentucky, but Lord! how that man hated slavery! He used to\nalways tell us (we never let our owners see us listenin' to him, though)\nthat God didn't intend for some men to be free and some men be in\nslavery. He used to talk to the owners, too, when they would listen to\nhim, but mostly they hated the sight of John Fee.\n\n\n\"In the night, though, he was a different man, for every slave who came\nthrough his place going across the river he had a good word, something\nto eat and some kind of rags, too, if it was cold. He always knew just\nwhat to tell you to do if anything went wrong, and sometimes I think he\nkept slaves there on his place 'till they could be rowed across the\nriver. Helped us a lot.\n\n\n\"I almost ran the business in the ground after I had been carrying the\nslaves across for nearly four years. It was in 1863, and one night I\ncarried across about twelve on the same night. Somebody must have seen\nus, because they set out after me as soon as I stepped out of the boat\nback on the Kentucky side; from that time on they were after me.\nSometimes they would almost catch me; I had to run away from Mr. Tabb's\nplantation and live in the fields and in the woods. I didn't know what a\nbed was from one week to another. I would sleep in a cornfield tonight,\nup in the branches of a tree tomorrow night, and buried in a haypile the\nnext night; the River, where I had carried so many across myself, was no\ngood to me; it was watched too close.\n\n\n\"Finally, I saw that I could never do any more good in Mason County, so\nI decided to take my freedom, too. I had a wife by this time, and one\nnight we quietly slipped across and headed for Mr. Rankin's bell and\nlight. It looked like we had to go almost to China to get across that\nriver: I could hear the bell and see the light on Mr. Rankin's place,\nbut the harder I rowed, the farther away it got, and I knew if I didn't\nmake it I'd get killed. But finally, I pulled up by the lighthouse, and\nwent on to my freedom--just a few months before all of the slaves got\ntheir's. I didn't stay in Ripley, though; I wasn't taking no chances. I\nwent on to Detroit and still live there with most of 10 children and 31\ngrandchildren.\n\n\n\"The bigger ones don't care so much about hearin' it now, but the little\nones never get tired of hearin' how their grandpa brought Emancipation\nto loads of slaves he could touch and feel, but never could see.\"",

        "text": "Born on December 6, 1838, Harriett Gresham can recall quite clearly the\nmajor events of her life as a slave, also the Civil War as it affected\nthe slaves of Charleston and Barnwell, South Carolina.\n\n\nShe was one of a, group of mulattoes belonging to Edmond Bellinger, a\nwealthy plantation owner of Barnwell. With her mother, the plantation\nseamstress and her father, a driver, she lived in the \"big house\"\nquarters, and was known as a \"house nigger.\" She played with the\nchildren of her mistress and seldom mixed with the other slaves on the\nplantation.\n\n\nTo quote some of her quaint expressions: \"Honey I aint know I was any\ndiffrunt fum de chillen o' me mistress twel atter de war. We played and\net and fit togetter lak chillen is bound ter do all over der world.\nSomethin allus happened though to remind me dat I was jist a piece of\nproperty.\"\n\n\n\"I heard der gun aboomin' away at Fort Sumpter and fer de firs' time in\nmy life I knowed what it was ter fear anythin' cept a sperrit. No, I\naint never seed one myself but--\"\n\n\n\"By der goodness o'God I done lived ter waltz on der citadel green and\nmarch down a ile o' soldiers in blue, in der arms o' me husban', and\nover me haid de bay'nets shined.\"\n\n\n\"I done lived up all my days and some o' dem whut mighta b'longed ter\nsomebody else is dey'd done right in der sight o' God.\" \"How I know I so\nold?\" \"I got documents ter prove it.\" The documents is a yellow sheet of\npaper that appears to be stationery that is crudely decorated at the top\nwith crissed crossed lines done in ink. Its contents in ink are as\nfollows:\n\n\nHarriett Pinckney, born September 25, 1790. Adeline, her daughter, born\nOctober 1, 1809. Betsy, her daughter, born September 11, 1811. Belinda,\nher daughter, born October 4, 1813. Deborah, her daughter, born December\n1, 1815. Stephen, her son, born September 1, 1818.\n\n\n\n\nHarriett's Grandchildren\n\n\nBella, the daughter of Adeline born July 5, 1827. Albert, son of Belinda\nborn August 19, 1833. Laurence, son of Betsy born March 1, 1835. Sarah\nAnn Elizabeth, daughter of Belinda born January 3, 1836. Harriett,\ndaughter of Belinda born December 6, 1838. (This record was given\nHarriett by Mrs. Harriett Bellinger, her mistress. Each slave received a\nsimilar one on being freed.)\n\n\nAs a child Harriett played about the premises of the Bellinger estate,\nleading a very carefree life as did all the slave children belonging to\nEdmond Bellinger. When she was about twelve years old she was given\nsmall tasks to do such as knitting a pair of stockings or dusting the\nfurniture and ample time was given for each of these assignments.\n\n\nThis was a very large plantation and there was always something for the\nscore of slaves to do. There were the wide acres of cotton that must be\nplanted, hoed and gathered by hand. A special batch of slave women did\nthe spinning and weaving, while those who had been taught to sew, made\nmost of the clothing worn by slaves at that time.\n\n\nOther products grown here were rice, corn, sugarcane, fruits and\nvegetables. Much of the food grown on the plantation was reserved to\nfeed the slaves. While they must work hard to complete their tasks in a\ngiven time, no one was allowed to go hungry or forced to work if the\nleast ill.\n\n\nVery little had to be bought here. Candles ware made in the kitchen of\nthe \"big house,\" usually by the cook who was helped by other slaves.\nThese were made of beeswax gathered on the plantation. Shoes were made\nof tanned dried leather and re-inforced with brass caps; the large herds\nof cattle, hogs and poultry furnished sufficient meat. Syrup and sugar\nwere made from the cane that was carried to a neighboring mill.\n\n\nHarriett remembers her master as being exceptionally kind but very\nsevere when his patience was tried too far. Mrs. Bellinger was dearly\nloved by all her slaves because she was very thoughtful of them.\nWhenever there was a wedding, frolic or holiday or quilting bee, she\nwas sure to provide some extra \"goody\" and so dear to the hearts of the\nwomen were the cast off clothes she so often bestowed upon them on these\noccasions.\n\n\nThe slaves were free to invite those from the neighboring plantations to\njoin in their social gatherings. A Negro preacher delivered sermons on\nthe plantation. Services being held in the church used by whites after\ntheir services on Sunday. The preacher must always act as a peacemaker\nand mouthpiece for the master, so they were told to be subservient to\ntheir masters in order to enter the Kingdom of God. But the slaves held\nsecret meetings and had praying grounds where they met a few at a time\nto pray for better things.\n\n\nHarriett remembers little about the selling of slaves because this was\nnever done on the Bellinger plantation. All slaves were considered a\npart of the estate and to sell one, meant that it was no longer intact.\n\n\nThere were rumors of the war but the slaves on the Bellinger place did\nnot grasp the import of the war until their master went to fight on the\nside of the Rebel army. Many of them gathered about their mistress and\nwept as he left the home to which he would never return. Soon after that\nit was whispered among the slaves that they would be free, but no one\nran away.\n\n\nAfter living in plenty all their lives, they were forced to do without\ncoffee, sugar salt and beef. Everything available was bundled off to\nthe army by Mrs. Bellinger who shared the popular belief that the\nsoldiers must have the best in the way of food and clothing.\n\n\nHarriett still remembers very clearly the storming of Fort Sumpter. The\nwhole countryside was thrown into confusion and many slaves were mad\nwith fear. There were few men left to establish order and many women\nloaded their slaves into wagons and gathered such belongings as they\ncould and fled. Mrs. Bellinger was one of those who held their ground.\n\n\nWhen the Union soldiers visited her plantation they found the plantation\nin perfect order. The slaves going about their tasks as if nothing\nunusual had happened. It was necessary to summon them from the fields to\ngive them the message of their freedom.\n\n\nHarriett recalls that her mistress was very frightened but walked\nupright and held a trembling lip between her teeth as they waited for\nher to sound for the last time the horn that had summoned several\ngenerations of human chattel to and from work.\n\n\nSome left the plantation; others remained to harvest the crops. One and\nall they remembered to thank God for their freedom. They immediately\nbegan to hold meetings, singing soul stirring spirituals. Harriett\nrecalls one of these songs. It is as follows:\n\n\n  T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye,\n  T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye,\n  T'ank ye Marster Jesus, t'ank ye\n  Da Heben gwinter be my home.\n  No slav'ry chains to tie me down,\n  And no mo' driver's ho'n to blow fer me\n  No mo' stocks to fasten me down\n  Jesus break slav'ry chain, Lord\n  Break slav'ry chain Lord,\n  Break slav'ry chain Lord,\n  Da Heben gwinter be my home.\n\n\nHarriett's parents remained with the widowed woman for a while. Had they\nnot remained, she might not have met Gaylord Jeannette, the knight in\nBlue, who later became her husband. He was a member of Company \"I\", 35th\nRegiment. She is still a bit breathless when she relates the details of\nthe military wedding that followed a whirlwind courtship which had its\nbeginning on the citadel green, where the soldiers stationed there held\ntheir dress parade. After these parades there was dancing by the\nsoldiers and belles who had bedecked themselves in their Sunday best and\ncome out to be wooed by a soldier in blue.\n\n\nMusic was furnished by the military band which offered many patriotic\nnumbers that awakened in the newly freed Negroes that had long been\ndead--patriotism. Harriett recalls snatches of one of these songs to\nwhich she danced when she was 20 years of age. It is as follows:\n\n\n  Don't you see the lightning flashing in the cane brakes,\n  Looks like we gonna have a storm\n  Although you're mistaken its the Yankee soldiers\n  Going to fight for Uncle Sam.\n  Old master was a colonel in the Rebel army\n  Just before he had to run away--\n  Look out the battle is a-falling\n  The darkies gonna occupy the land.\n\n\nHarriett believes the two officers who tendered congratulations shortly\nafter her marriage to have been Generals Gates and Beecher. This was an\nadded thrill to her.\n\n\nAs she lived a rather secluded life, Harriett Gresham can tell very\nlittle about the superstitions of her people during slavery, but knew\nthem to be very reverent of various signs and omens. In one she places\nmuch credence herself. Prior to the Civil War, there were hordes of ants\nand everyone said this was an omen of war, and there was a war.\n\n\nShe was married when schools were set up for Negroes, but had no time\nfor school. Her master was adamant on one point and that was the danger\nof teaching a slave to read and write, so Harriett received little \"book\nlearning.\"\n\n\nHarriett Gresham is the mother of several children, grandchildren and\ngreat grandchildren. Many of them are dead. She lives at 1305 west 31st\nStreet, Jacksonville, Florida with a grand daughter. Her second husband\nis also dead. She sits on the porch of her shabby cottage and sews the\nstitches that were taught her by her mistress, who is also dead. She\nembroiders, crochets, knits and quilts without the aid of glasses. She\nlikes to show her handiwork to passersby who will find themselves\nlistening to some of her reminiscences if they linger long enough to\nengage her in conversation--for she loves to talk of the past.\n\n\nShe still corresponds with one of the children of her mistress, now an\nold woman living on what is left of a once vast estate at Barnwell,\nSouth Carolina. The two old women are very much attached to each other\nand each in her letters helps to keep alive the memories of the life\nthey shared together as mistress and slave.",

        "text": "Bolden Hall was born in Walkino, Florida, a little town in Jefferson\nCounty, on February 13, 1853, the son of Alfred and Tina Hall. The Halls\nwho were the slaves of Thomas Lenton, owner of seventy-five or a hundred\nslaves, were the parents of twenty-one children. The Halls, who were\nborn before slavery worked on the large plantation of Lenton which was\ndevoted primarily to the growing of cotton and corn and secondarily to\nthe growing of tobacco and pumpkins. Lenton was very good to his slaves\nand never whipped them unless it was absolutely necessary--which was\nseldom! He provided them with plenty of food and clothing, and always\nsaw to it that their cabins were liveable. He was careful, however, to\nsee that they received no educational training, but did not interfere\nwith their religious quest. The slaves were permitted to attend church\nwith their masters to hear the white preacher, and occasionally the\nmaster--supposedly un-beknown to the slaves--would have an itinerant\ncolored minister preach to the slaves, instructing them to obey their\nmaster and mistress at all times. Although freedom came to the slaves in\nJanuary, Master Lenton kept them until May in order to help him with his\ncrops. When actual freedom was granted to the slaves, only a few of the\nyoung ones left the Lenton plantation. In 1882 Bolden Hall came to Live\nOak where he has resided ever since. He married but his wife is now\ndead, and to that union one child was born.\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte Martin\n\n\nCharlotte Mitchell Martin, one of twenty children born to Shepherd and\nLucinda Mitchell, eighty-two years ago, was a slave of Judge Wilkerson\non a large plantation in Sixteen, Florida, a little town near Madison.\nShepherd Mitchell was a wagoner who hauled whiskey from Newport News,\nVirginia for his owner. Wilkerson was very cruel and held them in\nconstant fear of him. He would not permit them to hold religious\nmeetings or any other kinds of meetings, but they frequently met in\nsecret to conduct religious services. When they were caught, the\n\"instigators\"--known or suspected--were severely flogged. Charlotte\nrecalls how her oldest brother was whipped to death for taking part in\none of the religious ceremonies. This cruel act halted the secret\nreligious services.\n\n\nWilkerson found it very profitable to raise and sell slaves. He\nselected the strongest and best male and female slaves and mated them\nexclusively for breeding. The huskiest babies were given the best of\nattention in order that they might grow into sturdy youths, for it was\nthose who brought the highest prices at the slave markets. Sometimes the\nmaster himself had sexual relations with his female slaves, for the\nproducts of miscegenation were very remunerative. These offsprings were\nin demand as house servants.\n\n\nAfter slavery the Mitchells began to separate. A few of the children\nremained with their parents and eked out their living from the soil.\nDuring this period Charlotte began to attract attention with her herb\ncures. Doctors sought her out when they were stumped by difficult cases.\nShe came to Live Oak to care for an old colored woman and upon whose\ndeath she was given the woman's house and property. For many years she\nhas resided in the old shack, farming, making quilts, and practicing her\nherb doctoring. She has outlived her husband for whom she bore two\nchildren. Her daughter is feebleminded--her herb remedies can't cure\nher!\n\n\n\n\nSarah Ross\n\n\nBorn in Benton County, Mississippi nearly eighty years ago, Sarah is the\ndaughter of Harriet Elmore and William Donaldson, her white owner.\nDonaldson was a very cruel man and frequently beat Sarah's mother\nbecause she would not have sexual relations with the overseer, a colored\nman by the name of Randall. Sarah relates that the slaves did not marry,\nbut were forced--in many cases against their will--to live together as\nman and wife. It was not until after slavery that they learned about the\nholy bonds of matrimony, and many of them actually married.\n\n\nCotton, corn, and rice were the chief products grown on the Donaldson\nplantation. Okra also was grown, and from this product coffee was made.\nThe slaves arose with the sun to begin their tasks in the fields and\nworked until dusk. They were beaten by the overseer if they dared to\nrest themselves. No kind of punishment was too cruel or severe to be\ninflicted upon these souls in bondage. Frequently the thighs of the male\nslaves were gashed with a saw and salt put in the wound as a means of\npunishment for some misdemeanor. The female slaves often had their hair\ncut off, especially those who had long beautiful hair. If a female slave\nwas pregnant and had to be punished, she was whipped about the\nshoulders, not so much in pity as for the protection of the unborn\nchild. Donaldson's wife committed suicide because of the cruelty not\nonly to the slaves but to her as well.\n\n\nThe slaves were not permitted to hold any sort of meeting, not even to\nworship God. Their work consumed so much of their time that they had\nlittle opportunity to congregate. They had to wash their clothes on\nSunday, the only day which they could call their own. On Sunday\nafternoon some of the slaves were sent for to entertain the family and\nits guests.\n\n\nSarah remembers the coming of the Yankees and the destruction wrought by\ntheir appearance. The soldiers stripped the plantation owners of their\nmeats, vegetables, poultry and the like. Many plantation owners took\ntheir own lives in desperation. Donaldson kept his slaves several months\nafter liberation and defied them to mention freedom to him. When he did\ngive them freedom, they lost no time in leaving his plantation which\nheld for them only unpleasant memories. Sarah came to Florida\nthirty-five years ago. She has been married twice, and is the mother of\nten children, eight of whom are living.",

        "text": "Rebecca Hooks, age 90 years, is one of the few among the fast-thinning\nranks of ex-slaves who can give a clear picture of life \"befo' de wah.\"\n\n\nShe was born in Jones County, Georgia of Martha and Pleasant Lowe, who\nwere slaves of William Lowe. The mother was the mulatto offspring of\nWilliam Lowe and a slave woman who was half Cherokee. The father was\nalso a mulatto, purchased from a nearby plantation.\n\n\nBecause of this blood mixture Rebecca's parents were known as \"house\nniggers,\" and lived on quarters located in the rear of the \"big house.\"\nA \"house nigger\" was a servant whose duties consisted of chores around\nthe big house, such as butler, maid, cook, stableman, gardner and\npersonal attendant to the man who owned him.\n\n\nThese slaves were often held in high esteem by their masters and of\ncourse fared much better than the other slaves on the plantation. Quite\noften they were mulattoes as in the case of Rebecca's parents. There\nseemed to be a general belief among slave owners that mulattoes could\nnot stand as much laborious work as pure blooded Negro slaves. This\naccounts probably for the fact that the majority of ex-slaves now alive\nare mulattoes.\n\n\nThe Lowes were originally of Virginia and did not own as much property\nin Georgia as they had in Virginia. Rebecca estimates the number of\nslaves on this plantation as numbering no more than 25.\n\n\nThey were treated kindly and cruelly by turns, according to the whims of\na master and mistress who were none too stable in their dispositions.\nThere was no \"driver\" or overseer on this plantation, as \"Old Tom was\ndevil enough himself when he wanted to be,\" observes Rebecca. While she\nnever felt the full force of his cruelties, she often felt sorry for the\nother slaves who were given a task too heavy to be completed in the\ngiven time; this deliberately, so that the master might have some excuse\nto vent his pentup feelings. Punishment was always in the form of a\nsevere whipping or revocation of a slave's privilege, such as visiting\nother plantations etc.\n\n\nThe Lowes were not wealthy and it was necessary for them to raise and\nmanufacture as many things on the plantation as possible. Slaves toiled\nfrom early morning until night in the corn, cotton sugar cane and\ntobacco fields. Others tended the large herds of cattle from which milk,\nbutter, meat and leather was produced. The leather was tanned and made\ninto crude shoes for the slaves for the short winter months. No one wore\nshoes except during cold weather and on Sundays. Fruit orchards and\nvegetables were also grown, but not given as much attention as the\ncotton and corn, as these were the main money crops.\n\n\nAs a child Rebecca learned to ape the ways of her mistress. At first\nthis was considered very amusing. Whenever she had not knitted her\nrequired number of socks during the week, she simply informed them that\nshe had not done it because she had not wanted to--besides she was not a\n\"nigger.\" This stubbornness accompanied by hysterical tantrums continued\nto cause Rebecca to receive many stiff punishments that might have been\navoided. Her master had given orders that no one was ever to whip her,\nso devious methods were employed to punish her, such as marching her\ndown the road with hands tied behind her back, or locking her in a dark\nroom for several hours with only bread and water.\n\n\nRebecca resembled very much a daughter of William Lowe. The girl was\nreally her aunt, and very conscious of the resemblance. Both had brown\neyes and long dark hair. They were about the same height and the clothes\nof the young mistress fitted Rebecca \"like a glove.\" To offset this\nlikeness, Rebecca's hair was always cut very short. Finally Rebecca\nrebelled at having her hair all cut off and blankly refused to submit to\nthe treatment any longer. After this happening, the girls formed a\ndislike for each other, and Rebecca was guilty of doing every mean act\nof which she was capable to torment the white girl. Rebecca's mother\naided and abetted her in this, often telling her things to do. Rebecca\ndid not fear the form of punishment administered her and she had the\ncunning to keep \"on the good side of the master\" who had a fondness for\nher \"because she was so much like the Lowes.\" The mistress' demand that\nshe be sold or beaten was always turned aside with \"Dear, you know the\nchild can't help it; its that cursed Cherokee blood in her.\"\n\n\nThere seemed to be no very strong opposition to a slave's learning to\nread and write on the plantation, so Rebecca learned along with the\nwhite children. Her father purchased books for her with money he was\nallowed to earn from the sale of corn whiskey which he made, or from\nwork done on some other plantation during his time off. He was not\npermitted to buy his freedom, however.\n\n\nOn Sundays Rebecca attended church along with the other slaves. Services\nwere held in the white churches after their services were over. They\nwere taught to obey their masters and work hard, and that they should be\nvery thankful for the institution of slavery which brought them from\ndarkest Africa.\n\n\nOn the plantation, the doctor was not nearly as popular as the \"granny\"\nor midwife, who brewed medicines for every ailment. Each plantation had\nits own \"granny\" who also served the mistress during confinement. Some\nof her remedies follows:\n\n\nFor colds: Horehound tea, pinetop tea, lightwood drippings on sugar.\nFor fever: A tea made of pomegranate seeds and crushed mint. For\nwhooping cough: A tea made of sheep shandy (manure); catnip tea. For\nspasms: garlic; burning a garment next to the skin of the patient having\nthe fit.\n\n\nShortly before the war, Rebecca was married to Solomon, her husband.\nThis ceremony consisted of simply jumping over a broom and having some\none read a few words from a book, which may or may not have been the\nBible. After the war, many couples were remarried because of this\nirregularity.\n\n\nRebecca had learned of the war long before it ended and knew its import.\nShe had confided this information to other slaves who could read and\nwrite. She read the small newspaper that her master received at\nirregular intervals. The two sons of William Lowe had gone to fight with\nthe Confederate soldiers (One never returned) and everywhere was felt\nthe tension caused by wild speculation as to the outcome of the war.\n\n\nCertain commodities were very scarce Rebecca remembers drinking coffee\nmade of okra seed, that had been dried and parched. There was no silk,\nexcept that secured by \"running the blockade,\" and this was very\nexpensive. The smokehouse floors were carefully scraped for any morsel\nof salt that might be gotten. Salt had to be evaporated from sea water\nand this was a slow process.\n\n\nThere were no disorders in that section as far as Rebecca remembers,\nbut she thinks that the slaves were kept on the Lowe plantation a long\ntime after they had been freed. It was only when rumors came that Union\nsoldiers were patrolling the countryside for such offenders, that they\nwere hastily told of their freedom. Their former master predicted that\nthey would fare much worse as freemen, and so many of them were afraid\nto venture into the world for themselves, remaining in virtual slavery\nfor many years afterward.\n\n\nRebecca and her husband were among those who left the plantation. They\nshare-cropped on various plantations until they came to Florida, which\nis more than fifty years ago. Rebecca's husband died several years ago\nand she now lives with two daughters, who are very proud of her.",

SQUIRES JACKSON\n\n\n\n\nLying comfortably in a bed encased with white sheets, Rev. Squires\nJackson, former slave and minister of the gospel living at 706 Third\nStreet cheerfully related the story of his life.\n\n\nBorn in a weather-beaten shanty in Madison, Fla. September 14, 1841 of a\nlarge family, he moved to Jacksonville at the age of three with the\n\"Master\" and his mother.\n\n\nVery devoted to his mother, he would follow her into the cotton field as\nshe picked or hoed cotton, urged by the thrashing of the overseer's\nlash. His master, a prominent political figure of that time was very\nkind to his slaves, but would not permit them to read and write.\nRelating an incident after having learned to read and write, one day as\nhe was reading a newspaper, the master walked upon him unexpectingly and\ndemanded to know what he was doing with a newspaper. He immediately\nturned the paper upside down and declared \"Confederates done won the\nwar.\" The master laughed and walked away without punishing him. It la\ninteresting to know that slaves on this plantation were not allowed to\nsing when they were at work, but with all the vigilance of the\noverseers, nothing could stop those silent songs of labor and prayers\nfor freedom.\n\n\nOn Sundays the boys on the plantation would play home ball and shoot\nmarbles until church time. After church a hearty meal consisting of\nrice and salt picked pork was the usual Sunday fare cooked in large iron\npots hung over indoor hearths. Sometimes coffee, made out of parched\ncorn meal, was added as an extra treat.\n\n\nHe remembers the start of the Civil war with the laying of the Atlantic\nCable by the \"Great Eastern\" being nineteen years of age at the time.\nHearing threats of the War which was about to begin, he ran away with\nhis brother to Lake City, many times hiding in trees and groves from the\nposse that was looking for him. At night he would cover up his face and\nbody with spanish moss to sleep. One night he hid in a tree near a\ncreek, over-slept himself, in the morning a group of white women fishing\nnear the creek saw him and ran to tell the men, fortunately however he\nescaped.\n\n\nAfter four days of wearied travelling being guided by the north star and\nthe Indian instinct inherited from his Indian grandmother, he finally\nreached Lake City. Later reporting to General Scott, he was informed\nthat he was to act as orderly until further ordered. On Saturday\nmorning, February 20, 1861, General Scott called him to his tent and\nsaid \"Squire; I have just had you appraised for $1000 and you are to\nreport to Col. Guist in Alachua County for service immediately.\" That\nvery night he ran away to Wellborn where the Federals were camping.\nThere in a horse stable were wounded colored soldiers stretched out on\nthe filthy ground. The sight of these wounded men and the feeble medical\nattention given them by the Federals was so repulsive to him, that he\ndecided that he didn't want to join the Federal Army. In the silent\nhours of the evening he stole away to Tallahassee, throughly convinced\nthat War wasn't the place for him. While in the horse shed make-shift\nhospital, a white soldier asked one of the wounded colored soldiers to\nwhat regiment he belonged, the negro replied \"54th Regiment,\nMassachusetts.\"\n\n\nAt that time, the only railroad was between Lake City and Tallahassee\nwhich he had worked on for awhile. At the close of the war he returned\nto Jacksonville to begin work as a bricklayer. During this period, Negro\nskilled help was very much in demand.\n\n\nThe first time he saw ice was in 1857 when a ship brought some into this\nport. Mr. Moody, a white man, opened an icehouse at the foot of Julia\nStreet. This was the only icehouse in the city at that time.\n\n\nOn Sundays he would attend church. One day he thought he heard the call\nof God beseeching him to preach. He began to preach in 1868, and was\nordained an elder in 1874.\n\n\nSome of the interesting facts obtained from this slave of the fourth\ngeneration were: (1) Salt was obtained by evaporating sea water, (2)\nthere were no regular stoves, (3) cooking was done by hanging iron pots\non rails in the fireplaces, (4) an open well was used to obtain water,\n(5) flour was sold at $12.00 a barrell, (6) \"shin-plasters\" was used for\nmoney, (7) the first buggy was called \"rockaways\" due to the elasticity\nof the leather-springs, (8) Rev. Jackson saw his first buggy as\ndescribed, in 1851.\n\n\nDuring the Civil War, cloth as well as all other commodities were very\nhigh. Slaves were required to weave the cloth. The women would delight\nin dancing as they marched to and fro in weaving the cloth by hand. This\nwas one kind of work the slaves enjoyed doing. Even Cotton seeds was\npicked by hand, hulling the seeds out with the fingers, there was no way\nof ginning it by machine at that time. Rev. Jackson vividly recalls the\ncroker-sacks being used around bales of the finer cotton, known as short\ncotton. During this same period he made all of the shoes he wore by hand\nfrom cow hides. The women slaves at that time wore grass shirts woven\nvery closely with hoops around on the inside to keep from contacting the\nbody.\n\n\nGleefully he told of the Saturday night baths in big wooden washtubs\nwith cut out holes for the fingers during his boyhood, of the castor\noil, old fashion paragoric, calomel, and burmo chops used for medicine\nat that time. The herb doctors went from home to home during times of\nillness. Until many years after the Civil War there were no practicing\nNegro physicians. Soap was made by mixing bones and lard together,\nheating and then straining into a bucket containing alum, turpentine,\nand rosin. Lye soap was made by placing burnt ashes into straw with corn\nshucks placed into harper, water is poured over this mixture and a\ntrough is used to sieze the liquid that drips into the tub and let stand\nfor a day.

Squires Jackson, 706 Third Street,\nJacksonville, Florida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT\nAmerican Guide, (Negro Writers' Unit)\n\n\nL. Rebecca Baker, Field Worker\nDaytona Beach, Florida\nJanuary 11, 1937\n\n\n\"PROPHET\" JOHN HENRY KEMP\n\n\n\n\nA long grey beard, a pair of piercing owl-like eyes and large bare feet,\nmark \"Prophet\" Kemp among the citizenry of Daytona Beach, Florida. The\n\"Prophet\", christened John Henry--as nearly as he can remember--is an 80\nyear old ex-slave whose remininiscences of the past, delight all those\nwho can prevail upon him to talk of his early life on the plantation of\nthe section.\n\n\n\"Prophet\" Kemp does not talk only of the past, however, his conversation\nturns to the future; he believes himself to be equally competent to talk\nof the future, and talks more of the latter if permitted.\n\n\nOketibbeha County, Mississippi was the birthplace of the \"Prophet\". The\nfirst master he can remember was John Gay, owner of a plantation of some\n2,700 acres and over 100 slaves and a heavy drinker. The \"Prophet\" calls\nGay \"father\", and becomes very vague when asked if this title is a blood\ntie or a name of which he is generally known.\n\n\nAccording to Kemp--Gay was one of the meanest plantation owners in the\nentire section, and frequently voiced his pride in being able to employ\nthe cruelest overseers that could be found in all Mississippi. Among\nthese were such men as G.T. Turner, Nels T. Thompson, Billy Hole, Andrew\nWinston and other men with statewide reputations for brutality. When all\nof the cruelties of one overseer had been felt by the slaves on the Gay\nplantation and another meaner man's reputation was heard of on the Gay\nplantation, the master would delight in telling his slaves that if they\ndid not behave, he would send for this man. \"Behaving\"--the \"Prophet\"\nsays, meant living on less food than one should have; mating only at his\ncommand and for purposes purely of breeding more and stronger slaves on\nhis plantation for sale. In some cases with women--subjecting to his\nevery demand if they would escape hanging by the wrists for half a day\nor being beaten with a cowhide whip.\n\n\nAbout these whippings, the \"Prophet\" tells many a blood-curdling tale.\n\n\n\"One day when an old woman was plowing in the field, an overseer came by\nand reprimanded her for being so slow--she gave him some back talk, he\ntook out a long closely woven whip and lashed her severely. The woman\nbecame sore and took her hoe and chopped him right across his head, and\nchild you should have seen how she chopped this man to a bloody death.\"\n\n\n\"Prophet\" Kemp will tell you that he hates to tell these things to any\ninvestigator, because he hates for people to know just how mean his\n\"fahter\" really was.\n\n\nSo great was the fear in which Gay was held that when Kemp's mother,\nArnette Young, complained to Mrs. Gay, that her husband was constantly\nseeking her for a mistress and threatening her with death if she did not\nsubmit, even Mrs. Gay had to advise the slaves to do as Gay demanded,\nsaying--\"My husband is a dirty man and will find some reason to kill you\nif you don't.\" \"I can't do a thing with him.\" Since Arnette worked at\nthe \"big house\" there was no alternative, and it was believed that out\nof the union with her master, Henry was born. A young slave by the name\nof Broxton Kemp was given to the woman as husband at the time John Kemp\nwas born, it is from this man that \"Prophet\" took his name.\n\n\nLife on the plantation held nothing but misery for the slaves of John\nGay. A week's allowance of groceries for the average small family\nconsisted of a package of about ten pounds containing crudely ground\nmeal, a slab of bacon--called side-meat and from a pint to a quart of\nsyrup made from sorghum, depending upon the season.\n\n\nAll slaves reported for work a 5 o'clock in the morning, except those\nwho cared for the overseer, who began their work an hour earlier to\nenable the overseer to be present at the morning checkup. This checkup\ndetermined which slaves were late or who had committed some offense late\non the day before or during the night. These were singled out and before\nthe rest of the slaves began their work they were treated to the sight\nof these delinquents being stripped and beaten until blood flowed; women\nwere no exception to the rule.\n\n\nThe possible loss of his slaves upon the declaration of freedom on\nJanuary 1, 1866 caused Gay considerable concern. His liquor-ridden mind\nwas not long in finding a solution, however, he barred all visitors from\nhis plantation and insisted that his overseers see to the carrying out\nof this detail. They did, with such efficiency that it was not until May\n8, when the government finally learned of the condition and sent a\nmarshall to the plantation, that freedom came to Gay's slaves. May 8, is\nstill celebrated in this section of Mississippi, as the official\nemancipation day.\n\n\nRelief for the hundreds of slaves of Gay came at last with the\ndeclaration of freedom for them. The government officials divided the\ngrown and growing crops; and some land was parcelled out to the former\nslaves.\n\n\nKemp may have gained the name \"Prophet\" from his constant reference to\nthe future and to his religion. He says he believes on one faith, one\nLord and one religion, and preaches this belief constantly. He claims to\nhave turned his back on all religions that \"do not do as the Lord says.\"\n\n\nIn keeping this belief he says he represents the \"True Primitive Baptist\nChurch\", but does not have any connection with that church, because he\nbelieves it has not lived exactly up to what the Lord expects of him.\n\n\nKemp claims the ability to read the future with ease; even to help\ndetermine what it will bring in some cases. He reads it in the palms of\nthose who will believe in him; he determines the good and bad luck;\nfreedom from sickness; success in love and other benefits it will bring\nfrom the use of charms, roots, herbs and magical incantations and\nformulae. He has recently celebrated what he believes to be his 80th\nbirthday, and says he expects to live at least another quarter of a\ncentury.",

        "name": "RANDALL LEE",
        "age": "Unknown",
        "address": "Florida",
        "state": "Florida",
        "text": "Randall Lee of 500 Branson Street, Palatka, Florida, was born at Camden,\nSouth Carolina about seventy-seven years ago, maybe longer.\n\n\nHe was the son of Robert and Delhia Lee, who during slavery were Robert\nand Delhia Miller, taking the name of their master, as was the custom.\n\n\nHis master was Doctor Miller and his mistress was Mrs. Camilla Miller.\nHe does not know his master's given name as no other name was ever heard\naround the plantation except Doctor Miller.\n\n\nRandall was a small boy when the war between the states broke out, but\njudging from what he remembers he must have been a boy around six or\nseven years of age.\n\n\nDuring the few years he spent in slavery, Randall had many experiences\nwhich made such deep impressions upon his brain that the memory of them\nstill remains clear.\n\n\nThe one thing that causes one to believe that he must have been around\nseven years of age is the statement that he was not old enough to have\ntasks of any importance placed upon him, yet he was trusted along with\nanother boy about his own age, to carry butter from the plantation dairy\ntwo miles to the 'big house.' No one would trust a child younger than\nsix years of age to handle butter for fear of it being dropped into the\ndirt. He must have at least reached the age when he was sent two miles\nwith a package and was expected to deliver the package intact. He must\nhave understood the necessity of not playing on the way. He stated that\nhe knew not to stop on the two-mile journey and not to let the butter\nget dirty.\n\n\nRandall had the pleasure of catching the pig for his father for Doctor\nMiller gave each of his best Negro men a pig to raise for himself and\nfamily. He was allowed to build a pen for it and raise and fatten it for\nkilling. When killing time came he was given time to butcher it and\ngrind all the sausage he could make to feed his family. By that method\nit helped to solve the feeding problem and also satisfied the slaves.\n\n\nIt was more like so many families living around a big house with a boss\nlooking over them, for they were allowed a privilege that very few\nmasters gave their slaves.\n\n\nOn the Miller plantation there was a cotton gin. Doctor Miller owned the\ngin and it was operated by his slaves. He grew the cotton, picked it,\nginned it and wove it right there. He also had a baler and made the\nbagging to bale it with. He only had to buy the iron bands that held the\nbales intact.\n\n\nDoctor Miller was a rich man and had a far reaching sight into how to\nwork slaves to the best advantage. He was kind to them and knew that the\nbest way to get the best out of men was to keep them well and happy. His\narrangement was very much the general way in that he allowed the young\nmen and women to work in the fields and the old women and a few old men\nto work around the house, in the gin and at the loom. The old women\nmostly did the spinning of thread and weaving of cloth although in some\ninstances Doctor Miller found a man who was better adapted to weaving\nthan any of his women slaves.\n\n\nEveryone kept his plantation under fence and men who were old but strong\nand who had some knowledge of carpentry were sent out to keep the fence\nin repair and often to build new ones. The fences were not like those of\ntoday. They were built of horizontal rails about six or seven feet long,\nrunning zig-zag fashion. Instead of having straight line fences and\nposts at regular points they did not use posts at all. The bottom rails\nrested upon the ground and the zig-zag fashion in which they were laid\ngave strength to the fence. No nails were used to hold the rails in\nplace. If stock was to be let in or out of the places the planks were\nunlocked so to speak, and the stock allowed to enter after which they\nwere laid back as before.\n\n\nBoys and girls under ten years of age were never sent into the field to\nwork on the Miller plantation but were required to mind the smaller\nchildren of the family and do chores around the \"big house\" for the\nmistress and her children. Such work as mending was taught the\ndomestic-minded children and tending food on the pots was alloted others\nwith inborn ability to cook. They were treated well and taught 'manners'\nand later was used as dining room girls and nurses.\n\n\nRandall's father and mother were considered lucky. His father was\noverseer and his mother was a waitress.\n\n\nDoctor Miller was a kind and considerate owner; never believed in\npunishing slaves unless in extreme cases. No overseer, white or colored\ncould whip his slaves without first bringing the slave before him and\nhaving a full understanding as to what the offense was. If it warranted\nwhipping them it had to be given in his presence so he could see that it\nwas not given unmercifully. He indeed was a doctor and practised his\nprofession in the keeping of his slaves from bodily harm as well as\nkeeping them well. He gave them medicine when they did not feel well and\nsaw to it that they took needed rest if they were sick and tired.\n\n\nNow, Robert Lee, Randall's father, was brought from Virginia and sold to\nDoctor Miller when he was a young man. The one who sold him told Doctor\nMiller, \"Here's a nigger who wont take a whipping. He knows his work and\nwill do it and all you will need to do is tell him what you want and its\nas good as done.\" Robert Lee never varied from the recommendation his\nformer master gave when he sold him.\n\n\nThe old tale of corn bread baked on the hearth covered with ashes and\nsweet potatoes cooked in like manner are vivid memories upon the mind of\nRandall. Syrup water and plenty of sweet and butter milk, rice and\ncrackling bread are other foods which were plentiful around the cabin of\nRandall's parents.\n\n\nCows were numerous and the family of Doctor Miller did not need much for\ntheir consumption. While they sold milk to neighboring plantations, the\nNegroes were not denied the amount necessary to keep all strong and\nhealthy. None of the children on the plantation were thin and scrawny\nnor did they ever complain of being hungry.\n\n\nThe tanning yard was not far from the house Doctor Miller. His own\nbutcher shop was nearby. He had his cows butchered at intervals and when\none died of unnatural causes it was skinned and the hide tanned on the\nplace.\n\n\nRandall as a child delighted in stopping around the tanning yard and\nwatching the men salt the hide. They, after salting it dug holes and\nburied it for a number of days. After the salting process was finished\nit was treated with a solution of water and oak bark. When the oak bark\nsolution had done its work it was ready for use. Shoes made of leather\nwere not dyed at that time but the natural color of the finished hide\nwas thought very beautiful and those who were lucky enough to possess a\npair were glad to get them in their natural color. To dye shoes various\ncolors is a new thing when the number of years leather has been dyed is\ncompared with the hundreds of years people knew nothing about it,\nespecially American people.\n\n\nRandall's paternal grandparents were also owned by Doctor Miller and\nwere not sold after he bought them. Levi Lee was his grandfather's name.\nHe was a fine worker in the field but was taken out of it to be taught\nthe shoe-makers trade. The master placed him under a white shoemaker who\ntaught him all the fine points. If there were any, he knew about the\ntrade. Dr. Miller had an eye for business who could make shoes was a\ngreat saving to him. Levi made all the shoes and boots the master,\nmistress and the Miller family wore. Besides, he made shoes for the\nslaves who wore them. Not all slaves owned a pair of shoes. Boys and\ngirls under eighteen went bare-footed except in winter. Doctor Miller\nhad compassion for them and did not allow them to suffer from the cold\nby going bare-footed in winter.\n\n\nAnother good thing to be remembered was the large number of chickens,\nducks and geese which the slaves raised for the doctor. Every slave\nfamily could rest his tired body upon a feather bed for it was allowed\nhim after the members of the master's family were supplied. Moss\nmattresses also were used under the feather beds and slaves did not need\nto have as thick a feather bed on that account. They were comfortable\nthough and Randall remembers how he and the other children used to fall\ndown in the middle of the bed and become hidden from view, so soft was\nthe feather mattress. It was especially good to get in bed in winter but\nnot so pleasant to get up unless 'pappy' had made the fire early enough\nfor the large one-room cabin to get warm. The children called their own\nparents 'pappy' and 'mammy' in slavery time.\n\n\nRandall remembers how after a foot-washing in the old wooden tub,\n(which, by the way, was simply a barrel cut in half and holes cut in the\ntwo sides for fingers to catch a hold) he would sit a few minutes with\nhis feet held to the fire so they could dry. He also said his 'mammy'\nwould rub grease under the soles of his feet to keep him from taking\ncold.\n\n\nIt seemed to the child that he had just gone to bed when the old tallow\ncandle was lighted and his 'pappy' arose and fell upon his knees and\nprayed aloud for God's blessings and thanked him for another day. The\nfield hands were to be in the field by five o'clock and it meant to rise\nbefore day, summer and winter. Not so bad in summer for it was soon day\nbut in winter the weather was cold and darkness was longer passing away.\nWhen daylight came field hands had been working an hour or more. Robert\nLee, Randall's father was an overseer and it meant for him to be up and\nout with the rest of the men so he could see if things were going\nallright.\n\n\nThe Randall children were not forced up early because they did not eat\nbreakfast with their 'pappy'. Their mother was dining-room girl in her\nmistress' house, so fed the children right from the Miller table. There\nwas no objection offered to this.\n\n\nDoctor Miller was kind but he did not want his slaves enlightened too\nmuch. Therefore, he did not allow much preaching in the church. They\ncould have prayer meeting all they wanted to, but instructions from the\nBible were thought dangerous for the slaves. He did not wish them to\nbecome too wise and get it into their heads to ran away and get free.\n\n\nThere was talk about freedom and Doctor Miller knew it would be only a\nmatter of time when he would loose all his slaves. He said to Randall's\nmother one day, \"Delhia you'll soon be as free as I am.\" She said. \"Sho'\nnuf massy?\" and he answered. \"You sure will.\" Nothing more was said to\nany of the slaves until Sherman's army came through notifying the\nslaves they were free.\n\n\nThe presence of the soldiers caused such a comotion around the\nplantation that Randall's mind was indelibly impressed with their\ndoings.\n\n\nThe northern soldiers took all the food they could get their hands on\nand took possession of the cattle and horses and mules. Levi, the\nbrother of Randall, and who was named after his paternal grandfather,\nwas put on a mule and the mule loaded with provisions and sent two miles\nto the soldier's camp. Levi liked that, for beside being well treated he\nreceived several pieces of money. The federal soldiers played with him\nand gave him all the food he wanted, although the Miller slaves and\ntheir children were fed and there was no reason for the child to be\nhungry.\n\n\nLevi Lee, the grandfather of young Levi and Randall, had a dream while\nthe soldiers were encamped round about the place. He dreamed that a pot\nof money was buried in a certain place; the person who showed it to him\ntold him to go dig for it on the first rainy night. He kept the dream a\nsecret and on the first rainy night he went, dug, and found the pot of\nmoney right where his dream had told him it would be. He took the pot of\nmoney to his cabin and told no one anything about it. He hid it as\nsecurely as possible, but when the soldiers were searching for gold and\nsilver money they did not leave the Negro's cabin out of the search.\nWhen they found the money they thought Levi's master had given him the\nmoney to hide as they took it from him. Levi mourned a long time about\nthe loss of his money and often told his grandchildren that he would\nhave been well fixed when freedom came if he had not been robbed of his\nmoney.\n\n\n\"Paddyroles\" as the men were called who were sent by the Rebels to watch\nthe slaves to prevent their escaping during war times, were very active\nafter freedom. They intimidated the Negroes and threatened them with\nloss of life if they did not stay and work for their former masters.\nDoctor Miller did not want any of his slaves treated in such manner. He\ntold them they were free and could take whatever name they desired.\n\n\nRobert Lee, during slavery was Robert Miller, as were all of the\ndoctor's slaves. After slavery was ended he chose the name Lee. His\nbrother Aaron took the name Alexander not thinking how it looked for two\nbrothers of the same parents to have different surnames. There are sons\nof each brother living in Palatka now, one set Lees and the others,\nAlexander.\n\n\nRandall, as was formerly stated, spent a very little time in slavery.\nMost of his knowledge concerning customs which long ago have been\nabandoned and replaced by more modern ones, is of early reconstruction\ndays. Just after the Civil War, when his father began farming on his own\nplantation, his mother remained home and cared for her house and\nchildren. She was of fair complexion, having been the daughter of a\nhalf-breed Indian and Negro mother. Her father was white. Her native\nstate was Virginia and she bore some of the aristocratic traits so\ncommon among those born in that state of such parentage. She often\nboasted of her \"blue blood Virginia stock.\"\n\n\nRobert Lee, Randall's father was very prosperous in early reconstruction\ndays. He owned horses, mules and a plow. The plow was made of point iron\nwith a wooden handle, not like plows of today for they are of cast iron\nand steel.\n\n\nChickens, ducks and geese were raised in abundance and money began\naccumulating rapidly for Robert and Delhia Lee. They began improving\ntheir property and trying to give their children some education. It was\nvery hard for those living in small towns and out in the country to go\nto school even though they had money to pay for their education. The\nnorth sent teachers down but not every hamlet was favored with such. (1)\n\n\nRandall was taught to farm and he learned well. He saved his money as he\nworked and grew to manhood. Years after freedom he left South Carolina\nand went to Palatka, Florida, where he is today. He bought some land\nand although most of it is hammock land and not much good he has at\nintervals been offered good prices for it. Some white people during the\n\"boom\" of 1925-26 offered him a few dollars an acre for it but he\nrefused to sell thinking a better price would be offered if he held on.\n(2)\n\n\nToday finds Randall Lee, an old man with fairly good health; he stated\nthat he had not had a doctor for years and his thinking faculties are in\ngood order. His eyesight is failing but he does not allow that to\nhandicap him in getting about. He talks fluently about what he remembers\nconcerning slavery and that which his parents told him. He is between a\nmulatto and brown skin with good, mixed gray and black hair. His\nfeatures are regular, not showing much Negro blood. He is tall and looks\nto weigh about one hundred and sixty-five pounds. His wife lives with\nhim in their two-story frame house which shows that they have had better\ndays financially. The man and wife both show interest in the progress of\nthe Negro race and possess some books about the history of the Negro.\nOne book of particular interest, and of which the wife of Randall Lee\nthinks a great deal, was written, according to her story, by John Brown.\nIt is called \"The History of the Colored Race in America.\" She could not\nfind but a few pages of it when interviewed but declared she had owned\nthe entire book for years. The pages she had and showed with such pride\nwere 415 to 449 inclusive. The book was written in the year 1836 and the\nfew pages produced by her gave information concerning the Negro, Lovejoy\nof St. Louis, Missouri.

        "text": "\"I's born on December 25, 1854. My muthuh wuz Allie Ann Lane. Aftuh\n'mancipation I tuk my daddies name Abbot--he wuz Anthony Abbot, an'\nbelonged to Ole' Joe Abbot, a neighbor. Our Mastuh wuz Joe Lane an' our\nMissus wuz Jane Knox Lane. Dey had a girl, Barbara Ellen, an' two boys,\nTom en' Ed. Latuh years dey had more boys but I nevuh knowd dem.\n\n\n\"De white folks house wuz big, wid porches, an flowers all aroun', an\nsweet locust trees in de do' yard. Dis wuz up in Perry County, a few\nmiles fum Seventy Six Landing.\n\n\n\"When Ole Mastuh died, dat wuz de fathuh ob young Mastuh Joe--he war\nsick a long time. Dar he lay fum openin' o' spring, 'bout de time flies\ncum, 'til wheat-sowin' time in de fall. An' it's de God's trufe, all dat\ntime he made me stan' side o' his bed--keepin' de flies offen him, I wuz\njes seben year ole but dere I had tuh stan, day en night, night en day.\nCo'se I'd sleep sumtimes wen he wuz sleepin'. Sumtimes when I'd doze, my\nbresh ud fall on he's face, den he'd take he's stick an' whack me a few\nacross de haid an' he'd say, 'Now I dare you to cry.' I cried, but he\ndidden see me do it.\n\n\n\"But at las' he died. Jane came in an' said, 'He's daid. You can go out\nto play now James.' She ustah come in to Ole Mastuh an say, 'Why don'\nyou let him go out tuh play an' let someone else stan' here?' But Ole\nMastuh say, 'No! I want James.' So now I runs outside--I meets ma sister\nan I says: 'By God, he's daid.' I didden know I wus cussin', she say 'I\ngonna tell Muthuh on you,' but I's so glad to be out, I runs till I meet\nUncle Rube an' I says, 'By God, he's daid,' den I runs an meets ma\nMuthuh, an' I tells her 'By God, he's daid.' She jes kinda turned her\nback tuh me an' I cud see her shakin'. She war laffin'!\n\n\n\"Aftuh de buryin' was over, Young Joe an' Jane stood dar on de porch an'\ndey call de darkies up one at a time. Fust dey calls ma Grampa an' young\nJoe says, 'Yo ole Mastuh's daid. Now I's you' Mastuh, an' Miss Jane here\nis your Missus. Do you unnerstand dat?' Grampa say 'Yessir' an pass on.\nNex' he call Lucy, den Aunt Hanna. To each one he says de same, 'I's\nyore Mastuh and Miss' Jane here is yore New Missus'--sum ob' em says\n'Yessir', sum ob' em jes kinda bows dey haid an' pass on. Wen he call\nmah Muthuh up an' say de same tuh her--she look at him a minit den she\nsay, 'I know'd yuh all dese year as Joe an' her as Jane, an' I ain't\ngonna start now callin' you Mastuh or Missus. I'll call you Joe an' Jane\nlike I allus done,' an' she walked away.\n\n\n\"One time 'fore dat she puddin near kill young Joe. She wuh hoeing corn\nin de field an he cum ridin'--I spect he war jes tryin' to be smaht but\nhe tells her to swallow dat tobbaccy she got in huh mouth. She don' pay\nhim no mind an' he tell her agin. Den she say, 'You chewing tobaccy?\nWhyn't yuh swaller dat?' Dat make him mad and he take a double rope en\nwhack her cross de sholders. Den she grab huh fingers roun' his throat,\nan his face wuh all black es my own 'fore dey pulls her offen him. Den\nOle Mastuh try tuh whup her, but he couldn' by hisself, so he sends fo'\nthree nigger-buyers dat's close by. When one o' em tells muthuh to put\nher han's togedder so he tie em, she grab him by de collar an' de seat\no' he's pants an knock's his haid agin a post like a battern' ram. Den\nOle Mastuh say, 'Men, yo' better go on home. I don' want my cullud folks\nto git hurt.' He said it like dat.\n\n\n\"My Muthuh wuz big an' strong. She nevuh worked in de house none but dey\nwarn't nothin' on de place dat she couldn' do. She cud cut down a big\ntree en chop off a rail length an' use a wedge an' maul an' make rails\nas good as anybody. Pore Muthuh, she shore did have a hard time. Dey\nwarn't never nuthin' for her but work hard all de time, she neveh came\nin fum de fiel' 'til dark, den had to feed wid a lantern.\n\n\n\"George Swan, a neighbor used tuh whup ole Felix with a\ncat-o'-nine-tails til we'd hear him holler over at our place.\n\n\n\"I 'member one time de snow wuz a foot deep an I had tuh gathuh corn. I\nwuz barefooted an' barehanded. Mah feet hurt so bad an' mah hands got so\nstiff I couldn' work mah fingers, but ah had tuh keep on breakin' off de\ncorn. Dat night mah feet crack open an' nex' mahnin' when I had tuh make\nde fires I lef' a track o' blood across de' flo.' Dey shore wuz mean to\nus but God Bless you, dey's all daid an' gone an' de Lawd has spared me.\n\n\n\"Wen de war cum, lots o' cullud men went off to fight fo de Government.\nYoung Mastuh Joe nevuh went but whenever de sojers cum aroun' Mastuh Joe\ncouldn' nevuh be foun.'\n\n\n\"One time a passel a' sojers cum to de place, dey didden go to de big\nhouse, but dat night dey spread straw fum de straw pile on de flo ob our\ncabin--an' slep dar. We slep in de loft. Nex' mornin' dey went to de\nbarn an' took de bran' new wagon an' de bes' team o' mules an' dey went\nto de smoke house an' hep deysefs. Dar wuz one man standin' on de wagon\ncuttin' down de hams an' side meat an' de udder packin' it in de wagon.\nJane cum out on de porch an' start raisin' a ruccus 'bout 'em takin' her\nmeat. De sojer whut wuz cuttin' down de meat pull out he's gun an' say\n'Whut dat she say?' Jane run in de house quick--but he got mad de way\nshe talk an' den' he take _all_ a de meat an' cans o' lard, an a barrel\nof molasses. We ain't nevuh seed dat wagon agin an' it wuz bran' new.\n\n\n\"Dey wuz a battle a few mile away an' dey said you couldn' walk on de\ngroun' wifout steppin on daid men.\n\n\n\"Wen de war wuz over dey didden want us to know 'bout it. Dey want to\nkeep us es long es dey could. But it cum out in de papers dat de Guvment\nmen wuz gonna cum round an' see so dey had tuh turn us loose.\n\n\n\"Abe Lincoln wuz de honestest President we evuh had. Ef it warn't fo'\nhim we'd still be in bondage.\n\n\n\"If you puts two hoss-shoes above youh door--one up an' one down--it'll\nshore catch de wiches if dey tries tuh come through.\n\n\n\"One time it wuz in de evenin' I wuz puttin hay in de pen fo de hosses\nat night, an I see a big white light a-cummin' up de lane jes a little\nabove de top o' de fence. It wuz big an' shiny white. I wuzn' rightly\nskeered but I stood dere watchin' it. It cum up an followed de' fence to\nde road. I watched to see did it go to de graveyard, an' shure nuf it\ndid. It meant sumpin' but I don' know whut. An den one day, 'bout noon I\nseed sumpin. I wuz out side dar an a little dog cum towards me. It wo' a\nbright collar, shinin' like, an' pretty.

        "text": "_God Got A Hold On Her_\n\n\nOne of the oldest ex-slaves encountered in Missouri is \"Aunt\" Hannah\nAllen of Fredericktown, who claims she is 107 years old. According to\nMadison County records, Aunt Hannah gave her age as 82 when she made\napplication for a marriage license in Fredericktown in 1912.\n\n\nIn spite of her extreme age, Aunt Hannah is able to do all of the work\naround her house and she frequently walks up town and back, a distance\nof several blocks. Her eyesight is very good and even at her advanced\nage she does not have to wear glasses. She claims her grandfather was a\nwhite man and she attributes her unusual health to several causes. She\nwas well treated as a slave during her younger years when she was under\nthe ownership of a family named Bollinger. She is childless and has been\ncontent to live on the same spot during the last 71 years. Being a\nNegro, she naturally does not take life seriously but as she expresses\nit \"jes' lives it like it comes\".\n\n\nIn reviewing the incidents which she was able to recall on the occasion\nof the writer's recent visit to her home, she outlined her story as\nfollows:\n\n\n\"Down in Pocahontas, Arkansas, a man had 400 slaves and de boss would\nallow an old colored man to have meetins every Saturday night and of a\nFriday night dey would have a class meeting. Several of dem got religion\nright out in de field and would kneel down in de cornfield. De boss went\nhome and told his wife he thought de slaves was losin' their minds\n'cause dey was all kneeling down in de field. De boss' daughter also got\nreligion and went down to de mourners' bench. De colored church finally\nmade de boss and his whole family get religion. De old white mistress\nwould sing and pray while she washed dishes, milked de cows, and made\nbiscuits. So dey called de doctor and he come and said dat God had got a\nhold on her.\n\n\n\"One of de darkies had a baby out in de field about eleven o'clock one\nmorning. De doctor come out there to her. She was sick a long time\n'cause she got too hot before de chile was born. After dis happened de\nboss got to be a better man. Dis old boss at first would not let the\ndarkies have any church meetins.\n\n\n\"On Sunday dere at home de colored folks could get all de water dat ran\nfrom de maple trees. De slaves would get through their work for de boss\nand den dere would sometimes be three days when dey could work for\nthemselves. Den dey would get paid for working for others and den buy\nclothes. Dey had de finest boots.\n\n\n\"Dey did not want de mistress to tell me when we was free 'cause dere\nwas only two of us slaves left there. De other slaves already done run\noff. I did not want to leave. When I was a slave I learned to do a job\nright or do it over. I learned to sew, cook, and spin. We set by de\nfireside and picked a shoe full of cotton and den we could go to bed.\nBut you did a lot before you got dat shoe full of cotton when it was\npressed down. Dis was almost enough to pad a quilt with. De white\nchildren would be getting their lessons den and dey used a pine torch\nfor a light to see by.\n\n\n\"I was paid nothin' after slavery but just stayed with de boss and dey\ngave me things like a calf, clothes, and I got to go to church with dem\nand to camp meetings and picnics. Dey would have big basket meetings\nwith pies, hogs, sheep and de like. Dey did not allow me to go with\nother colored girls if dey had no character. We all set down and ate at\nde same table with de white folks and tended de sick together. Today if\nde parents would make their children do like dey did in slavery, den we\nwould have a better race. I was better off dan de free people. I think\ndat slavery taught me a lot.\n\n\n\"In Fredericktown I worked for my mistress' sister and made $10 a month.\nMy father told me to always keep myself clean and nice and to comb my\nhair. When I lived in Fredericktown de people I worked for always tried\nto keep me from going out with de low class. After I washed de supper\ndishes, I would have to go upstairs and cut out quilts and I did not\nlike it but it was good for me.\n\n\n\"My first husband gave $50 for dis lot I am living on. Dat was just at\nde end of de war. He hauled de logs and chinked and white-washed dem and\nwe had two rooms and a hall. It was a good, nice, warm house. He was a\ncarpenter. About twenty-five years later my husband built him a frame\nhouse here and dug him a well. He had 4 dozen chickens, 15 head of hogs,\n2 horses, 2 wagons, and a buggy to go back and forth to de church at\nLibertyville, New Tennessee, or Pilot Knob. We lived together fifty\nyears before he died. He left me dis home, three horses, 3 milk cows and\nthree hogs.\n\n\n\"We had no children but 'dopted a little boy. He was my husband's\nsister's child. De boy's mother took a notion that she wanted to work\nout and she was just a young girl so we took de boy at about de age of\nthree and he was with us about six years. He went to a colored school\nden but a white teacher taught him. We adopted a girl too from Marquand.\nDe girl's father was a colored man and de mother was a white woman. De\nwoman den married a white man in Marquand and her husband did not want\nde child so we took her at about three years old. We did not have her no\ntime 'til she died. We have helped to raise about a dozen children. But\nI have quit doing dat now. I now has my second husband; he always liked\nto have children around but we ain't had none of our own.\n\n\n\"When my first husband died, he did not owe fifteen cents. He just would\nnot go in debt to nobody. He attended de Masonic lodge. After he died I\nwent to work. I brought wood, washed, ironed, and cooked. I have made as\nhigh as $15 a week and keep. I took care of a man's children after him\nand his wife separated. We have had two houses burn down right here. One\nof our houses was a little too close to Saline Creek and it was\ncondemned and we tore it down and built de one we have now, thirteen\nyears ago. Harry Newberry has a mill and he give us de lumber to build\ndis house.\n\n\n\"We have a lot in de colored graveyard. I have no insurance but Mr.\nAllen has some kind of insurance, so if he gets hurt traveling he will\nget something. We is getting, together, $25 in pensions a month and we\nis living pretty well right now. Some months we spend from seven to\neight dollars on food. Almost everything is cash for us. I been going\nbarefoot about ten years. I come mighty near going barefoot in de winter\ntime. We been getting a pension about two years and we was on relief for\ntwo or three years before dat. Our biggest debt is a doctor bill of\nabout $60.\n\n\n\"Some of de colored folks is better off now and some is worser. De young\nrace says we who was slaves is ten times worse off den dey 'cause we had\nbosses and couldn't read or write. But I say de young race is got all\ndis to go by and dey ought to be much better off dan dey is. We is\nbetter off in one sense dan de young race 'cause about half of dem don't\nknow how to raise their children and dey don't know how to do nothing. I\nthink our folks has just as good a chance now as de white folks but dey\ndon't get cultivated. Dey say today dat I don't know nothing 'cause I\nwas a slave and all I learned was what de master learnt me. But I know\nenough to keep out of devilment. I think all dis speed shows dat people\nain't got no sense at all.\"\n\n\n    *Interview with Aunt Hannah Allen,*\n    *aged 107, Fredericktown, Mo.*\n    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*\n\n\n\"I's born in 1830 on Castor River 'bout fourteen miles east of\nFredericktown, Mo. My birthday is December 24. Yes, sir, I is 107 years\nold dey say and dey got de records up there in de court house to prove\nit. De first time I married Adam Wringer in 1866 and was married by\nSquire Addison in Fredericktown. In 1912 on August 11 me and de parson\nwas married in de Methodist church here and dis was de largest one in\nFredericktown. 'Bout six or seven hundred come for de celebration. I\nguess I is 'bout de oldest person in Madison County.\n\n\n\"My father come from Perry County. He was named Abernathy. My father's\nfather was a white man. My white people come from Castor and dey owned\nmy mother and I was two years old when my mother was sold. De white\npeople kept two of us and sold mother and three children in New Orleans.\nMe and my brother George was kept by de Bollingers. This was in 1832. De\nwhite people kept us in de house and I took care of de babies most of de\ntime but worked in de field a little bit. Dey had six boys.\n\n\n\"Our house joined on to de house of de white folks. Many times I slept\non de floor in front of de fireplace near de mistress. Dey got hold of a\nbig buffalo rug and I would sleep on it. De Bollinger boy, Billy\nBollinger, would go to de cabin and sleep with George, my brother. Dey\nthought nothing of it. Old man Bollinger sent some colored folks up to\nhis farm in Sabula and Billy cried to go long with dem. He let Billy go.\nI stayed with old Aunt Betsy on Castor River.\n\n\n\"Before de Civil War broke out we were at Sabula and a Mr. Schafer and\nMr. Bollinger started to take de slaves to Texas. Dey got as far as\nRockport, near Hot Springs. A man by de name of John Higdon from\nColorado married Olive Bollinger and he was injured in de arm in de\nBattle of Fredericktown. Den John Higdon went to Rockport after he was\nshot and had taken de oath of allegiance. Higdon's wife died in Rockport\nand she had a child two years old. I took de baby to care for. De wife\nwas to be buried back home so dey took de body in a wagon with just a\nsheet over it towards Little Rock. I was sitting in de wagon holding de\ntwo year old baby. On de way 'bout ten miles out we were captured by\nFederal soldiers and took back to Rockport. De body was put in a room\nfor two weeks and den placed in a vault above de ground and stayed dar\nfor 'bout eight years before Mr. Higdon took it back home to bury.\n\n\n\"Higdon took me and his child to 'bout eight miles from Hot Springs to a\nhotel he had bought. Once he come up to de hotel with two government\nhorses and put me and de child on a horse and we were on de way to\nLittle Rock. We rode dat way for 'bout two weeks and was captured again\nnear Benton. Higdon had on a Union cape. De soldiers asked us all 'bout\nde horses, guns, child, etc. De soldiers let him keep his gun 'cause dey\nsaid it wouldn't kill a flea. But dey cut de buttons off de coat, and\ntook de spurs off of his heels and said he could not go any further. Dey\ntook me and de baby and made us sit on de ground. De soldiers took\nHigdon to de river. It was late in de day. Dey said dey was going to\ntransfer him back to Missouri and sell de horses. Higdon had papers from\nCol. Lowe and Chambers. De soldiers were Masons and after a while dey\nall come back just a-laughing and shaking hands.\n\n\n\"We were put on a boat at Little Rock going toward St. Louis. De child\ntook de small pox from a lady on de boat. When we got on de boat dey\nwere firing at the wheels of de boat from across de river. I was feeding\nde baby and de chamber-maid come out and said, 'I would drown him'. I\nsaid, 'If you do dat you will have to drown me too'. Dey had Higdon\nlocked up on de boat and he did not get to see de baby for two weeks\nwhen we got to St. Louis. Just as we got to St. Louis, two white ladies\nsaw de baby who was so sick and dey went out and got some clothes for\nit. De doctor come on de boat and vaccinated me. De sores on the baby\nwere as big as half dollars.\n\n\n\"Den after we got to St. Louis we went to Whitworth's in Ironton,\nMissouri. Higdon was on de back porch and a soldier shot at him and took\nhim to headquarters dat night. Whitworth had some soldiers take us to\nSabula, twenty-five miles away. De soldiers den took Higdon back to\nIronton until de war was over. Higdon married three times.\n\n\n\"John, the baby, was raised by his grandmother and step-mother in St.\nLouis. John married the daughter of a county clerk in Luxemburg,\nMissouri. And he became county clerk for thirty years in dis county.\nJohn died 'bout two years ago this July.\n\n\n\"I 'member how dey would treat one slave. De master took two boards and\ntied one to de feet and another to de hands and tied her back with ropes\nand whipped her with a cat-o'-nine-tails till she bled and den took salt\nand pepper and put in de gashes. I can 'member when I was in Iron County\nde soldiers stole de boss' horse and de boss had to go to Patton to git\nit. Once de soldiers made me get up in de smoke house and throw down\nsome ham. De authorities 'gaged de soldiers for stealing from de people.\nI had to carry some stuff out for Sam Hildebrand to eat.\n\n\n\"I've been living here since de Civil War. Dis is de third house that I\nbuilt on dis spot. What I think 'bout slavery? Well we is gettin' 'long\npurty well now and I believe it's best to not agitate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW.C. Parson Allen\n\n\n\n\n    *Interview with W.C. Parson Allen,*\n    *aged 78, Fredericktown, Mo.*\n    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*\n\n\n\"I's born in Harrison County, in 1859 and was raised in Georgetown,\nScott County. Yes, I was born a slave. My boss was John McWiggin, a\nScotch-Irishman, who raised hogs, sheep, hemp, and darkies. He had 'bout\n230 darkies on de place. We lived in log cabins. Dey had slip doors for\nde windows. Man, what you talkin' 'bout? We never saw a window glass.\nHad 'bout fourteen cabins and dey was placed so dat de old master could\nsit on his porch and see every one of dem. My mistress was Alice\nMcWiggin.\n\n\n\"I was kep' busy shooin' flies off de table with a pea-fowl brush,\nwatching de chickens, and gettin' de maple sugar from de root of de\ntrees. We made a pocket at de base of de tree and dipped out de sugar\nwater with a bucket. Had 'bout 40 or 50 trees along de road. Had all\nkinds of berries. We never got no whippin', only a little boxin'. In\nchurch we sat on one side and de whites on de other. De white preacher\nalways read a special text to de darkies, and it was this, 'Servants,\nobey your master.'\n\n\n\"John McWiggin was a son of a Federal. His brother, Keenie, was a\nConfederate. When de Confederate army come Keenie took de silver goblets\ndown to de creek and gave de soldiers water to drink. Den when de other\nsoldiers come Johnie would help his crowd. De soldiers took Mac's\niron-gray saddle hosses to Lexington, and de boss had to pay $500 to get\nde hosses back. He got some of his mules back. De bushwackers and\nnightriders were here. But de boss got 'round it this way. He had de\nslaves dig trenches 'cross de road and tie grape vines over it. Den have\nde darkies go up on de hill and sing corn songs. Den de nightriders come\na-rushing and sometimes dey would get four or five whites in these\nraids. It would kill de men and horses too, when dey fell into de\ntrench. On Saturday night we had a shindig. We would eat chicken and\npound cake and of course whiskey made in Kentucky. De jail was called de\nwatch-house.\n\n\n\"After de war de government instituted religious trainin' 'mong de\ncolored people and gave dem white teachers. I was in Lexington, Ky.,\nwhen I learned my letters. Just how dese latter-day children learn to\nread without de letters is a mystery to me.\n\n\n\"I's one of de preachers of de church here and am a deacon, too. I\nstudied at de University of Louisville, where I was a theological\nstudent, and was one of de main orators in de school.\n\n\n\"I've married a lot of 'em, in Poplar Bluff, Kennett, Farmington, and\nFredericktown, and have preached quite a few funerals. Have preached\nsome brush arbor sermons and stood under a arbor when we was married. I\nbaptized 42 in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\"I ain't eligible enough to express 'bout slavery. I ain't sayin'\nnothing.\"",

        "text": "_Hale And Hearty At 119_\n\n\nCharles Gabriel Anderson, 119 years old, lives at 1106 Biddle Street in\nSt. Louis alone. He is 5 feet, 3 inches in height, has mixed gray hair\nand weighs 145 pounds.\n\n\nHe is slightly bent, but does not have to wear glasses, and is able to\ngo anywhere in the city without assistance. He has a good memory, and\ncheerful attitude. Seated in the church of God in Christ, a store front\nchurch, next door to his home, where he attends because of the\nconvenient location, he tells the writer the following story:\n\n\n\"I was born January 5, 1818 in Huntsville, Alabama de son of Sallie\nMcCree and George Bryant. My owner's name was Miss Margaret Tony. She\nsold me to Edmond Bryant while I was quite young. I sometimes go by de\nname of Bryant.\n\n\n\"I was just big enough to carry water and help a bit with farming while\nMiss Tony had me, but I jedge I was 'bout 14 years old when Mr. Bryant\ngot me, 'cause I was old enough to plow and help with de cotton and I\ndone a man's size work in his field. I was his slave when de war broke\nout. I joined de army in 1864. I used to git a pension of $65 a month,\nnow I only git $56 a month but last month I didn't git no check at all.\nI don't know why. Wish I could find out 'cause I needs it bad to live\non. I used to nurse de white folks children when I was a little boy. I\nmade a better nurse dan most girls, so jest kept on at it till I was old\nenough to be a field hand.\n\n\n\"I had a hard time till de war broke out. Soon as I got a chance, I run\noff and went to de army. I served two years and six months. I come out\nin 1866. 'Course I was in de hospital till '66. I don't know how long I\nwas in der wounded. But I do know when I got better, I was such a good\nnurse de doctors kept me in de government hospital to help nurse dem\nother soldiers and dere sure 'nough was a heap of 'em up dere. Dat was\nin Madison, Wisconsin. After dey turned me loose from de hospital, I\nwent to work in a barber shop up dere. I worked in it one year to learn\nde trade. After I learned de barber trade I don't remember how much\nlonger I stayed dere. I left dere and went to Dodgeville, Wisconsin and\nopened a barber shop of my own and run it about two or three years. Den\nI went to Dubuque, Iowa, and stayed about one year and barbered in a\nhotel dere.\n\n\n\"I come to St. Louis in 1876 and started being a roust-about and firing\non boats. I changed from dat after awhile and went to driving private\ncarriages and done glass cleaning.\n\n\n\"I got what little education I got, 'tending night school here in St.\nLouis. I got 'nough to git ordained in de Chamber Street Baptist Church\nfor a preacher. Den I come in holiness in Elder Jones, Church of God in\nChrist on Kennerly Avenue. I pastored the Macedonia Spiritual Church\neight years in East St. Louis, Ill. I been married twice and am de\nfather of three children, all dead, and both wifes dead. I don't know\nhow long none of 'em been dead. My mother died while I was in de army\nand my father got drowned before I was born. I only had two sisters and\nthree brothers, and dey is all dead. My brother, Jim Bryant, died in de\narmy. He enlisted one year before I did, but in a different regiment. I\nhas voted many times in my life time, and always voted Republican till\ndis last election, I decided I better vote de Democrat ticket and I did,\nand I don't regret it either.\n\n\n\"I gits my washing done by de neighbors dat do washing and I eat at de\nrestaurant on de corner. De Ku Klux never bothered me none 'cause I\nstayed up north out of dere reach.\n\n\n\"I 'member de old slaves used to sing: 'Amazing Grace How Sweet De\nSound'; 'I want to be a Soldier, Since de Lord has set me Free';\n'Fighting for Liberty'; 'Why Should We Start, and Fear to Die'; 'Death\nis the Gate to Endless Joy and Yet We Dread to Enter There'; 'The pain,\nthe groan, the dying strife, rights our approaching souls away'; 'Jesus\ncan make a dying bed, soft as downy pillows are, whilst on his breast, I\nlean my head and breathe our lives out sweetly there'.\n\n\n\"Sister, I just think dis younger generation is gone totally. Dey ain't\ntaught right in de home, and de teachers can't do a thing with 'em. If\nit wasn't for de prayers goin' up to de throne of grace from all us old\nsaints what's got sense enough to trust in nothin' else but Jesus, de\nwhole business would be gone plum to rack. Dey ain't even got sense\nenough to know dat. De young folks' mind is on worldly goods and worldly\npleasures and dere ain't no good in none of it, just misery and woe, to\nall it touches. And still dey don't seem to see, and don't want to see\nand nobody got any sense, can't make' em see. God help dis generation is\nall dat I can say.\n\n\n\"I figure I lived dis long 'cause in de first place, I obey God, I never\ndid drink liquor or smoke in my whole life. I never wore glasses but\nprecious little and dat was when I did what little reading and writing I\nknowed how to do; 'cause after my children went to school long enough to\nread and write for me I just stopped doing dat little bit. Now dey's all\ndead so I just makes marks, and lets it go at dat. I am a member of The\nKennerly Avenue Church of God in Christ.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Baker\n\n\n\n\n    *Jane Baker,*\n    *Farmington, Missouri.*\n    *Interview with Chas.

Bell,*\n    *St. Louis, Missouri.*\n    *(Written by  Grace E. White.)*\n\n\n    _She Loves Army Men_\n\n\nThe subject of this sketch is Mary A. Bell, 85 years old, living in a\n4-room frame cottage at 1321 Argus Street, St. Louis County, Missouri.\n\n\nMary Bell has a very light complexion, light brown eyes, mixed gray\nhair, very long and straight. She has fine features. She is quite bent,\nand shows her years, but is cheerful. She is living in the same yard\nwith her daughter who is married and lives next door with her family,\nMrs. Virginia Miller and six children. Her story follows:\n\n\n\"I was born in Missouri, May 1, 1852 and owned by an old maid named Miss\nKitty Diggs. I had two sisters and three brothers. One of my brothers\nwas killed in de Civil War, and one died here in St. Louis in 1919. His\nname was Spot. My other brother, four years younger than I, died in\nOctober, 1925 in Colorado Springs.\n\n\n\"Slavery was a mighty hard life. Kitty Diggs hired me out to a\nPresbyterian minister when I was seven years old, to take care of three\nchildren.\n\n\n\"I nursed in dat family one year. Den Miss Diggs hired me out to a baker\nnamed Henry Tillman to nurse three children. I nursed there two years.\nNeither family was nice to me. De preacher had a big farm. I was only\nseven years old so dey put me on a pony at meal time to ride out to de\nfield and call de hands to dinner. After the meals were finished, I\nhelped in de kitchen, gathered the eggs, and kept plenty busy. My father\nwas owned by de Lewis family out in the country, but Miss Diggs owned my\nmother and all her children. I never attended school until I came to St.\nLouis. When Abraham Lincoln was assassinated I had never been to school.\nDat same year I attended school at Benton Barracks and went about six or\nseven months with de soldiers. There was no Negro school in St. Louis at\ndat time. The next school I attended was St. Paul Chapel, 11th and Green\nStreets. I went dere about six months. De next place I went to school\nwas 18th and Warren. I went there about two years. My next school was\n23rd and Morgan, now Delmar Boulevard, in a store building. I went dere\nbetween two and three years. I was very apt and learned fast. My father\nat de time I was going from school to school, was a nurse in Benton\nBarracks and my mother taken in washing and ironing. I had to help her\nin de home with de laundry.\n\n\n\"I married at de age of twenty-two and was de mother of seven children,\nbut only have two now living, my daughter dat lives next door and in de\nsame yard with me, and a son in the Philippine Islands. I have eight\ngrandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\n\n\"I so often think of de hard times my parents had in dere slave days,\nmore than I feel my own hard times, because my father was not allowed to\ncome to see my mother but two nights a week. Dat was Wednesday and\nSaturday. So often he came home all bloody from beatings his old nigger\noverseer would give him. My mother would take those bloody clothes off\nof him, bathe de sore places and grease them good and wash and iron his\nclothes, so he could go back clean.\n\n\n\"But once he came home bloody after a beating he did not deserve and he\nrun away. He scared my mother most to death because he had run away, and\nshe done all in her power to persuade him to go back. He said he would\ndie first, so he hid three days and three nights, under houses and in\nthe woods, looking for a chance to cross the line but de patrollers were\nso hot on his trail he couldn't make it. He could see de riders hunting\nhim, but dey didn't see him. After three days and three nights he was so\nweak and hungry, he came out and gave himself up to a nigger trader dat\nhe knew, and begged de nigger trader to buy him from his owner, Mr.\nLewis, because Marse Lewis was so mean to him, and de nigger trader knew\nhow valuable he was to his owner. De nigger trader promised him he would\ntry to make a deal with his owner for him, because de nigger trader\nwanted him. So when dey brought father back to his owner and asked to\nbuy him, Mr. Lewis said dere wasn't a plantation owner with money enough\nto pay him for Spot. Dat was my father's name, so of course that put my\nfather back in de hands of Marse Lewis. Lewis owned a large tobacco\nplantation and my father was de head man on dat plantation. He cured all\nde tobacco, as it was brought in from the field, made all the twists and\nplugs of tobacco. His owner's son taught him to read, and dat made his\nowner so mad, because my father read de emancipation for freedom to de\nother slaves, and it made dem so happy, dey could not work well, and dey\ngot so no one could manage dem, when dey found out dey were to be freed\nin such a short time.\n\n\n\"Father told his owner after he found out he wouldn't sell him, dat if\nhe whipped him again, he would run away again, and keep on running away\nuntil he made de free state land. So de nigger trader begged my father\nnot to run away from Marse Lewis, because if he did Lewis would be a\nruined man, because he did not have another man who could manage de\nworkers as father did. So the owner knew freedom was about to be\ndeclared and my father would have de privilege of leaving whether his\nowner liked it or not. So Lewis knew my father knew it as well as he\ndid, so he sat down and talked with my father about the future and\npromised my father if he would stay with him and ship his tobacco for\nhim and look after all of his business on his plantation after freedom\nwas declared, he would give him a nice house and lot for his family\nright on his plantation. And he had such influence over de other slaves\nhe wanted him to convince de others dat it would be better to stay with\ntheir former owner and work for him for their living dan take a chance\non strangers they did not know and who did not know dem. He pleaded so\nhard with my father, dat father told him all right to get rid of him.\nBut Lewis had been so mean to father, dat down in father's heart he felt\nLewis did not have a spot of good in him. No place for a black man.\n\n\n\"So father stayed just six months after dat promise and taken eleven of\nde best slaves on de plantation, and went to Kansas City and all of dem\njoined the U.S. Army. Dey enlisted de very night dey got to Kansas City\nand de very next morning de Pattie owners were dere on de trail after\ndem to take dem back home, but de officers said dey were now enlisted\nU.S. Soldiers and not slaves and could not be touched.\n\n\n\"In de county where I was raised de white people went to church in de\nmorning and de slaves went in de afternoon. I was converted at the age\nof fourteen, and married in 1882. My husband died May 27, 1896 and I\nhave been a widow every since. I do get a pension now, I never started\nbuying dis little old 4-room frame dwelling until I was sixty-four years\nold and paid for it in full in six years and six months.\n\n\n\"I am a member of St. Peter's A.M.E. Church in North St. Louis. I told\nyou my father's name was Spot, but that was his nickname in slavery. His\nfull name was Spottwood Rice and my son's full name is William A. Bell.\nHe is enlisted in de army in de Philippine Islands. I love army men, my\nfather, brother, husband and son were all army men. I love a man who\nwill fight for his rights, and any person that wants to be something.\"",

He is now about eighty-five\nyears old, and has lived his entire life in Marion, Monroe, and Ralls\nCounties. In chatting about his life and experiences he says:\n\n\n\"My mother and father come from Virginia. I don't know how old I is, but\nI have had one birthday and the rest is anniversaries. I think I is\nabout eighty-five. I was born in slavery and when I was eight years old\nwas bonded out to Sam Briggs of New London. Mr. Briggs was a good master\nand I didn't have a whole lot to do. My job was to take his children to\nschool and go after dem of an evening. In the mean time I just piddled\naround in de fields.\n\n\n\"In de evening when de work was done we would sit 'round and play\nmarbles and sing songs. We made our songs up as we went along. Sometimes\ndere would be a corn shuckin' and dat is when we had a good time, but we\nalways shucked a lot of dat corn.\n\n\n\"I did not go to school any and today I do not even have de sense of\nwriting at all. Unless some one guides my hand I cannot make a mark. I\nwish I wasn't so old now so I could go to school and learn how to read\nand write.\n\n\n\"I 'member one day when de master was gone, us darkies thought we would\nhave a party. I guess de master knowed we was going to have one, 'cause\ndat night, when we was all having a good time, my sister said to me,\n'Bill, over dere is old master Sam.' He had dressed up to look like us\nand see what we was up to. Master Sam didn't do anything to us dat time\n'cause he had too good a time hisself.\n\n\n\"At the age of thirteen my sister was bonded out to some man who was\nawful mean, she was a bad girl, too. After we were freed she told me all\nabout her old master. She said, 'One Christmas my master was drunk and I\nwent to wish him a merry Christmas and get some candy. He hit at me and\nI ducked and run 'round de house so fast I burnt de grass 'round dat\nhouse and I know dere ain't no grass growing dere yet.'\n\n\n\"When we was freed our master didn't give us nothing, but some clothes\nand five dollars. He told us we could stay if we wanted to, but we was\nso glad to be free dat we all left him. He was a good man though.\n\n\n\"Durin' de war we could not leave de master's house to go to de\nneighbors without a pass. If we didn't have a pass de paddyrollers would\nget us and kill us or take us away.\n\n\n\"After de freedom come we could vote, but some of us never done it. To\ndis day I ain't never voted. De government has been as good to us as dey\ncould. I get ten dollars a month and think I should have more, but I\nknow dey is giving us all dey can and some day dey will give us\nex-slaves more.\n\n\n\"I am glad dat we have our churches and schools. We don't have no\nbusiness being with de good white people. Dey is cultured and we is not,\nbut some day we will be as good and dey will be glad to have us 'round\ndem more. Just 'cause we is black is no sign that we ain't good niggers.\n\n\n\"I don't like de way de younger generation is doin'. As my neighbors\nsay, 'the devil is gettin' dem and it won't be long 'fore he will come\nand get dem all.' When I was young we didn't act like dey do now-a-days.\nWe didn't get drunk and stay dat way and kill each other. De good Lord\nis going to do something to all of dem, mark my word.\n\n\n\"I can't 'member some of the songs we sung, but when we was freed we\nsang 'Master's Body is Molding in the Grave', and I know some of dem\nis.\"\n\n\nWilliam Black lives by himself in a house owned by his daughter. He is\nunable to do any kind of manual labor and has not done any kind of work\nfor about five years. He is active in religious affairs and attends\nchurch regularly. He is one of the few persons living in Marion County\nwho raises tobacco. His garden plot, five by ten feet, is close to his\nhouse.",

In his younger days he was big and powerful and even now at\nthe age of 84 he is above the average in build. He owns his home and his\nis the last colored family to remain in this neighborhood which is\nrapidly being built up with modern homes.\n\n\nGeorge has little education, unlike his wife who is much younger and\nuses fairly good English. He sits on his porch and thoroughly enjoys\ntalking of the long ago with those who appreciate listening to his\nstory.\n\n\n\"Benton Hill?\" he said. \"Sure, it's hanted. I seen things and heard\nthings there lots of times. Good gosh amighty! One night we was driving\nthrough dere and we heard something dat sound like a woman just a\nscreaming. Old man Ousbery was with me and he wanted to stop and see\nwhat it was but I says, 'No you don't. Drive on. You don't know what dat\nmight be.' Another time we's driving by there, and dey was a great big\nmule just standing cross de road and he just wouldn't move. I says,\n'Just drive on and he'll get out of de way.' But he didn't. When we gets\nto him, he just parts right in de middle and half stands on one side and\nhalf on de other. We didn't look 'round. No, mo'--we just made dat hoss\ngo.\n\n\n\"I don't know what makes dem hants round there--lessen it's de gold\nwhat's buried dere. And you know de spirits always come back fer gold.\nSure dey's money buried dere. Didn't you all know dat? Lots of folks is\ndug there, but dey ain't never found it. Why dey is holes 'round dere\nwhere men's been digging for dat gold.\n\n\n\"Dey was one man had a-what you call it? A 'vinin' rod. That points to\nwhere things is hid. But he didn't find it neither. And then out by de\nMaberry place, close to Gordonville--who-e-e--I's sure enough seen\nthings out dere lots of times. You know where dat clump of peach trees\nis at de corner of de fence? Dey always seems to come from right there.\nI worked out there for a long time. We'd get out to work early,\nsometimes 'twasn't good and day.\n\n\n\"One morning I's coming along there, on a hoss I was, and I met a\nhossman. He looks funny to me and when he asks me something I says, 'Git\non. I ain't talking to you!' But he says, 'Wait, I wants to talk to\nyou!' As I says, he looks funny to me and I pulls out my pistol. I\nalways carries my gun, and I think if he makes a pass at me I'll git\nhim. But I goes on without looking back. Now just dat one man is all I\nseen, but when I gets past, dey is lots of talking like dey is six or\neight men. But I didn't look back.\n\n\n\"One morning I'd got out there real early, too early to go into de field\nand I thinks I'll rest awhile under de tree. I had my eyes shut for a\nwhile when something bothered me. When I opened up my eyes there was a\nlot a strange hosses standing 'round me in a ring. I jumped up and\nhollered, 'git out'. Dey turned and ran and dey run right off a steep\nbank on the other side of de field.\"\n\n\n\"Did you see them down there?\" he was asked.\n\n\n\"Cose I never, nobody else never neither, dey wasn't dere, dat's why,\"\nhe answered.\n\n\n\"Lord, when I thinks of de way we used to work. Out in de field before\nday and work till plumb dark. My boss would say, 'George take two men,\nor maybe three men, and git dat field plowed, or dat woods patch\ncleared'. And he knowed if he tell me, de work would be done.\n\n\n\"And I worked at anything. One time I steamboated for eight years. But\nwhat do dese young folks know 'bout work? Nuthin'! Look at dat grandson\nof mine, just crossed de porch--why he's fourteen and he can't even use\na ax. Too young? Go on with you!\n\n\n\"I tells you dese young folks just don't know how to work. Dey has too\nmuch studying up here (pointing to his head and making motions like\nwheels going round.) When I's his age I's working at anything I could\nfind. I worked on a farm and on a steamboat, I carried cross ties--just\nanything where I could earn money. And I saved money, too. When we\nbought dis house I had $2,400 saved up. And men was stronger in dem days\nand had better health.\n\n\n\"Dese young folks want too easy living. And dey ain't brung up to show\nrespect to old folks like we is.

We didden know nuthin' 'bout\nlearnin'. Dey wuz a church, but we didden go much, 'en we never had no\nkind 'er gatherin's. Dey wouldn' let de cullered folks congregate--no,\nshu, why, even de man over at de store wouldn't let mo' dan two cullud\nfolks come in at a time.\n\n\n\"I didden even know what money wuz.

        "text": "The subject of this sketch, Richard Bruner, is one of the oldest negroes\nin Saline County. He claims to be ninety-seven years old and lives in\nthe little town of Nelson.\n\n\nHis humble dwelling, a gray and weathered frame building of about four\nrooms and two porches, sets in a square of yard thick with blue grass,\nold fashioned flowers like holly hocks, flowering pinks and marigolds\nmaking bright spots of color. Heavily laden fruit trees, apples,\npeaches, plums and pears shade every part of the plot. A splendid walnut\ntree towers over the smaller fruit trees, the house and the porch, while\nat the side of the house a garden spot contains a fine variety of\nvegetables.\n\n\nAs the writer approached, the old man was seated on a cot on the little\nporch. The wall back of him was hung with all kinds of tools, a saw, a\nhammer, bits of wire, a piece of rope, part of a bridle, and a wing,\napparently from a big gray goose. His long curling, gray hair is neatly\nparted and brushed and he wears a mustache and short beard or chin\nwhiskers, an unusual thing among negroes in this part of the country.\nHis skin is a light brown color and his eyes bright with his second\neyesight which enables him to look on the world without glasses.\n\n\nBack of the house and down the hill, is a well equipped slaughter house,\nwhere for many years this old man has taken care of the butchering of\nthe meat for his white friends and neighbors. He is too old now to take\ncharge of this work, but the house and equipment is still in good\nrepair.\n\n\nThis aged Negro has been for many years a highly respected preacher of\nthe gospel. His own account of his life and adventures follows:\n\n\n\"Yes'm I remembers before de war, I remember being a water-boy to de\nfield hands before I were big enough to work in de fields. I hoed\ntobaccer when I was about so high, (measuring with his hands about three\nand one half feet from the floor).\n\n\n\"Yes'm dey thrashed me once, made me hug a tree and whip me, I had a\nterrible temper, I'm part Choctaw Indian. We went to de white folks\nchurch on Sundays, when we went to camp meeting we all went to de\nmourners' bench together. De mourners' bench stretch clear across de\nfront of de Arbor; de whites and de blacks, we all just fell down at de\nmourners' bench and got religion at de same place. Ole Marsa let us\njoine whichever church we wanted, either de Methodist or Baptist.\n\n\n\"No, I never went to no school, de colonel's daughter larnt me to write\nmy name, that was after de wah. No'm, dey didn't care if we had dances\nand frolics. We had de dances down at de quarters and de white folks\nwould come down and look on. Whenever us niggas on one plantation got\nobstreperous, white folks hawns dey blowed. When de neighbors heard dat\nhawn here dey come to help make dat obstreperous nigga behave. Dey\nblowed de hawn to call de neighbors if anybody died or were sick.\"\n\n\nIn response to the question as to where he joined the Federal Army,\nBruner replied:\n\n\n\"Well you see I was a runaway nigga; I run away when I was about grown\nand went to Kansas. When de war broke out I joined de 18th United States\nColored Infantry, under Capt. Lucas. I fit three years in de army. My\nold Marsa's two boys just older than me fit for de south. Dey was mighty\ngood boys, I liked dem fine.\"",

She died when\nI was about eight years old and my father died about forty years ago.\nHis name was George Bryant but he went by de name of Brock. I was livin'\nin Pilot Knob when Price's raid come through. De government gave de old\nman a team to make it to St. Louis. Me and my mother and my brother who\nwas deaf and dumb went with dem but de soldiers captured us and de old\nman jumped off de mule and high tailed it to de woods. My mother got out\nof de wagon and took my brother to de woods too. De soldier rid up to de\nwagon and said, 'Little boy, you don't need to be afraid, I'm after your\nfather.'\n\n\n\"I started to get out of de wagon and fell down under de mule and dere I\nwas on de ground. I got up and made for de woods and got in a hole where\nde hogs was a-wallerin'. I had on a dress and was standin' in de mud up\nto my knees. I got lost out in de woods for three days. I just laid\naround and slept behind a log at night and durin' de day I played in dat\nmud-hole. If I see'd somebody comin' in de woods I would go and hide.\n\n\n\"A colored lady found me after three days and called me and took me\nalong. I stayed with her three weeks before my mother found me. I like\nto eat up everything dey had when I first got something to eat after\nbein' in de woods so long. We went from one place to another and along\nabout two o'clock in de night you would hear something hit de house like\nhail. Den we had to come out of dere and hit for de woods. We would go\nto another house 'bout eight or nine miles away and I'll be switched if\ndere would not be hail fallin' on dat house about two o'clock in de\nmornin'. It was them bushwhackers again. We kept runnin' for about three\nweeks. We would go to peoples' houses for food and some of dem would\ngive us enough food to eat for two or three days.\n\n\n\"I'll show you now how my mother happened to find me. One night we was\nin a old house and we didn't dare talk loud 'cause we was afraid de\nsoldiers would hear us. We was afraid to light a light. All at once my\nmother who was in one side of de room said: 'I wish I could find my\nlittle boy.' Den de lady I was with said: 'I found a little boy playin'\nin de hole where de hogs wallowed. Come over here and see if dis is your\nboy.' So my mother come over and said: 'I can't see him but I sure can\ntell by puttin' my hand on his head.' So she put her hand on my head and\nsaid: 'Yes, dat's sure 'nough my boy.'\n\n\n\"But I wouldn't go with her. I wouldn't leave dat other woman. About 2\no'clock dat night de hail began to hit de house and we had to git out.\nSo I went with de other woman and it was about two or three days before\nI would go with my mother. Two or three days later we all met again and\nmy mother said: 'Don't you know your mother.' I knowed it was my mother\n'cause my brother what was deaf and dumb was with her. Den I went on\nwith her. I would talk to my brother with signs.\n\n\n\"Den we went to a little place away, away from Pilot Knob. Den my mother\nwas free and she said, 'Robert, we is all free.' I was too young to know\nanything 'bout it. After we was free we put in a little stuff in de\nground. We had to go to de woods to get some brush and make a brush\nfence around de garden to keep de cattle out. We got permission from a\nman dat owned a farm to build our own log house. It took two or three\ndays to build a one room house. We made up some mud with water and made\nit stiff enough to stick to de chinckin'. Den we cut a big hole in one\nend of de building and got some flat rocks and made a fireplace. We put\nmud on de inside and outside of de chimney. Sometimes de chimney would\ncatch on fire and we had to run to de branch to get water and put it\nout. Sometimes it would catch on fire twice or three times in one night.\n\n\n\"We took old gunny sacks and put leaves in dem to make a bed and we\nslept on de floor and had a old spread and de white folks gave us some\nold quilts. To make a fire we got some spunk out of a log and then took\ntwo flint rocks and to-reckly it would make a spark and catch that\nspunk. We banked de fire at night.\n\n\n\"We never had no doctor. My mother would go out in de woods and get\nherbs and if I had de stomach ache we would put a little bit of\nturpentine on a piece of sugar. If I had de headache we would put a\npiece of brown paper and vinegar or horse radish leaves on de head. In\ntwo or three hours us kids would be out playin' and kickin' up our\nheels. We would go out and get some goose grass and make a little bit of\ntea and pour it down for de stomach ache. We would get dis black root\nfor constipation. We used a turnip and scraped it and would bind de foot\nwhen it was frost bit.\n\n\n\"I'se been married four times and had children by two wifes, had eight\nchildren altogether and all are girls but two. Ain't but one living and\ndat is Ed McFadden what's livin' in Fredericktown, Mo. He works for\nDeguire at de lumber mill and has been workin' dere for about 30 years.\nMost of my children died young, but three girls lived to get married.\nI'se married three times by a preacher and once by de squire.\n\n\n\"I steamboated six years on de Mississippi between St. Paul and New\nOrleans. I got $1 a day and board, and we sure would pack dem sacks and\nsing dem songs. De old mate would holler at us: 'Give me a song boys'.\nAnd den we would start out. It 'peared like de work went ahead easier\nwhen we was singin'. It would take us four weeks to make de rounds\nbefore we got back to St. Louis. We hauled potatoes, sheep, wheat, corn,\ncattle, horses, and cotton. There was 45 of us altogether. I never got\nhit but one time on de boat. De mate with knucks on hit at another\nfeller for 'cause he was loafin' and hit me and knocked me and my load\nin de river. I couldn't swim but dey fished me back in de boat and\nrolled me over and over to run dat water out of me. I run on de 'Bald\nEagle' and de 'Spread Eagle'. My mamma got after me to quit and when I\ngot hit she got uneasy about me, but I would hear dat whistle blowin' my\nfeet'd begin to itch and I could not help but go down to de old boat\nagain. De old mate had my name 'doubled up'. It was Bob Rob.\n\n\n\"Den I went to wheelin' iron ore at Sulphur Springs. All day long I\nworked with 16 men loading barges with wheel barrows. Every time you\ntook a load it had 800 pounds, and I'se telling you all, dat's some\niron. This iron ore came from dat big hill down in Pilot Knob. We had\nstraps over our shoulders and dey saved our hands and arms. It took\nabout a day and a half to load a barge and we got paid by de ton. I did\ndat for about a year.\n\n\n\"I give my wife all my money and all de time she was givin' it away to\nanother man. So dat was when I left her flat and went down to\nCharleston, Cairo, and Kentucky and stayed three years. I was workin' in\nde tobacco for three years. Dere was too much stoopin' in dat and I\ndecided to come back to St. Louis. We only got $12 a month in de tobacco\nfields and worked from 4 o'clock in de morning to 8 or 9 o'clock in de\nnight time. Dere was 9 or 10 in de tobacco field.\n\n\n\"Den I worked in de iron foundry in a St. Louis furnace. I carried iron\nand hustled in de casting hole. Dey paid pretty good and we got $1.50 to\n$1.75 a day. I worked up dere two years and den come to Sulphur Springs\nand went on de farm and got $26 a month. I got to be a trusty and dey\nput it in my hands. I worked here five years for old Mike Green. I was\nsingle den. I went down on John Coffman's farm in Ste. Genevieve County\nto work for him. Worked on his farm for 'bout 15 years and got $26 a\nmonth and board. He had a gang of 'em working for him. He had rows of\ncabins 'most a mile long. Dat was where I got married a second time.\n\n\n\"After I left dere I went down below Fredericktown and went on a farm\nagain and stayed right dere for seven years. I lost my wife at dat place\nand sold my land. I paid $90 for 40 acres dere and had paid 'bout half\non it. So I sold it back to de man what I bought it from for $45 and\nwent to Bonne Terre and worked for de St. Joe Lead Co. and worked on de\nlead well and den went to tappin'. I got $1.60 for 12 hours. I worked\ndere until dey moved de works up here and den I followed de works right\nup here. Den I worked 'bout 30 years here doing de same kind of work\nwith the same pay.\n\n\n\"When I quit workin' here it was about 13 years ago and I was about 62\nyears old. De company just laid me off on account of age. Den de\nsupervisor dere got me a job as janitor at de colored school here at\n$7.00 a month. I've been janitor ever since. Dere is ten colored\nfamilies in Herculaneum, and about 50 colored people here now but dere\nused to be mostly all colored but most of 'em done left. I lived here in\ndis house a little more dan 5 years without payin' rent. Den after my\nson got on the WPA dey begins to take $3.85 rent a month. We been payin'\nrent 'bout two years. The St. Joe Company owns all de houses here. We\ngets our water free. I'se been gettin' a pension about a year now.\n\n\n\"I shot a fellow once in de leg. It was de man who my wife was givin' my\nmoney to. I had a trial at Kimmswick before de Justice of Peace and\nserved three months in de county jail at Hillsboro. The white folks come\ndown and got me out and it didn't cost me a thing.\n\n\n\"A man has got more his own say now dan he did have. We can do more what\nwe want to and don't have to go to de other fellow. Slavery might a done\nde other fellow some good but I don't think it ever done de colored\npeople no good. Some of dem after freedom didn't know how to go out and\nwork for demselves. Down at old John Coffman's lots of dem stayed with\nhim right along same as if dey wasn't free. Dey didn't want to leave\nhere 'cause dey didn't think dey could live if dey left him. But when\ndey got away up here in St. Louis dey know they can make a livin',\nwithout Marse John, but they got to 'go up against it.' Dependin' on\nsomebody else is poor business. When I was workin' I depended on myself.\nIf dey would have freed de slaves and give dem a piece of ground I think\ndat would been a heap better dan de way dey did. Look at de Indians!\nThey're all livin'. I'se always been able to eat and sleep.\n\n\n\"I can't hardly tell about de younger generation, I can say dat if it\nwas not for de old generation today de young ones would go up 'salt\ncreek'. Dey don't want to work. Some of dem is pretty smart. Pride is de\nreason dey don't want to work. Dey dress up and strut out and have a\ngood time. De old folks is de cause of it. Dey say, 'I don't want my boy\nto do dat; I don't want him to work hard'. I say, let him make out de\nsame as us old folks did. If de colored people don't pick up and see\nabout business dey is going to be behind. Dese young people won't go to\nchurch. You can't get dem in dere. Dat's de place dey ought to go. I'se\nbeen goin' to church since I was a boy. Colored folks did not raise me.\nWhite folks learned me to go to church. Mrs. Baker, at Cook's\nSettlement, would read de Bible every night at 9 o'clock and she would\n'splain it to me. If she was not able, her daughter read it. We need a\nworkhouse for de young people.\n\n\n\"De first time I ever cast my vote was for Garfield who got killed. It\nwas in Kimmswick. Been votin' ever since, and vote all through dem all.\nI'se been talked to lots of times, tellin' me how to vote. Dey even give\nme a ballot and show me how to vote. I would stick dat in my pocket and\nvote like I pleased. I ain't never sold my vote but I'se been offered\n$10 for it. But I say if you is goin' to get beat, I say you is just\nbeat. You ain't no man to go over there and cast your vote. You got to\nstand for your point.\n\n\n\"De first automobile I ever seen had buggy wheels. It made a terrible\nracket. Mrs. Baker told me dat people was goin' sometime to be ridin' in\nautomobiles and in de air.\"",

        "text": "The wonderful meteoric display known as the \"star shower\" or \"the time\nwhen the stars fell,\" occured in 1833. It was on the night of the 12th\nand 13th of November. Many ignorant persons concluded that the Judgement\nday had come, or that the end of the world was at hand. Negroes\nespecially were very much frightened. A dance was in progress on a\nBuchanan County farm, attended exclusively by slaves from the\nneighborhood. When the star shower began the negroes were first made\naware of the fact by a messenger who ran frantically into the cabin and\nshouted, \"If you all wants to git to hebin, you'd better 'gin to say yo'\npra'rs mighty sudden, 'cause the Lawd is a-comin' wi' de fire an' de\nglory an' de wuld'll be burnt up like a cracklin' 'fo mo'nin.\"\n\n\nThe dancers ran out, fell on their knees and cried for mercy. Not for\nmany days did they recover from their fright. One old negro declared\nthat if the world and his life were spared he would agree to break\neighty pounds of hemp every day instead of fifty, as he had been\naccustomed to do.\n\n\nThe Negro was a part of the early Buchanan County family. They were\nblack slaves and happy.\n\n\nThe negro Mammy had her proper place in the scheme of things. She was no\nfiction of a later day novelist, but genuine, gentle, untiring, and\nfaithful. The Negro mammy merits a prominent place in the picture an\nartist might paint, for on her broad shoulders was carried the\ngeneration which made the early history of Missouri fascinating and\ngreat.\n\n\nWhen once a week came \"Johnny Seldom\"--as the hot biscuits made of wheat\nflour were called in Old Missouri--all other kinds of bread faded into\nnothingness. Two kinds of biscuits were typically Missourian--the large,\nfluffy, high biscuits--which looked like an undersized sofa pillow--and\nbeaten biscuits, small, crisp, delicious--the grandfather of all\nafternoon tea refreshments. No \"Po' white trash\" can make beaten\nbiscuits. Indeed, much of the finest flavor of all cookery belonged\nintuitively to the Negro. How the Negro cook managed to get biscuits\nsteaming hot from the cookroom a quarter of a mile distant through the\nopen yard to the dining room table has always been a mystery. She did\nit, however, and successfully.\n\n\nMr. Alex Bufford, an ex-slave, lives at 1823 Seneca street, St. Joseph,\nMissouri. Mr Bufford, (everyone calls him Uncle Alex) does not know how\nold he is, but says he does remember that he was a grown man at the time\nof the Civil War.\n\n\nI heard about Uncle Alex from one of the ladies in the reference room at\nthe Public Library in St. Joseph, Mo. She told me I would have to see\nUncle Alex right at the noon hour or in the evening, as he would be at\nwork during working hours. I didn't ask her what kind of work he did but\nI heeded her advice about seeing him at the noon hour. I arrived at his\nplace about 11:50 A.M. As I got out of my car I happened to look up the\nalley. An old Negro driving a one-horse wagon was just entering it. I\nguessed in a minute that this was the old gentleman I wanted to see.\nWhen he approached I did not tell him at first what I wanted but started\ntalking about the weather. I saw in a minute the old fellow was going to\nbe interesting to talk to.\n\n\nAfter we had commented about the weather, I told him what I wanted.\nUncle Alex, \"Ya sir, I'll be bery glad to tell you anything I kin\nrecollect, but I don't remember like I used to.\" He said, \"I don't know\nhow ole I am, but I was a grown man at the time of de war and I guess\nI'se de oldest man in de city. I was born in Buchanan County and have\nlibed here all my life. I only been out de state once in my life and dat\nwuz ober to Elwood seberal years ago. (Elwood, Kansas is only about 2\nmiles west of St. Joseph.) I'se just don't keer to go any place.\"\n\n\nTo my question about his family he replied. \"Ya sir, I hab four\ndaughters and one son libing, but da don't help dis ole man any. Until I\ngot de ole age pension seberal months ago, I had a terbil time making a\nlibing.\"\n\n\nUncle Alex and his brother who is younger than he, live together. The\nbrother is an old man more feeble than Uncle Alex.\n\n\nAfter the War Uncle Alex worked on the farm for the Conetts, near\nFaucett, Mo. in Buchanan County for several years. Then he moved to town\nand worked for the same people in their brickyard until just a few years\nago.\n\n\nThe house Uncle Alex lives in now belongs to the people he worked for so\nlong.

She had 12 cows and lots of\nbutter and a spring-house.\n\n\n\"To eat we had corn meal and fried meat dat had been eaten by bugs. We\nhad some gravy and all ate 'round de pans like pigs eating slop.

De first thing I ever\nlearned to read was, 'I see you Tom. Do you see me?' I worked for\nintelligent people and learned a great deal. After I married I wanted to\nlearn a great deal and how to read. At de camp in Mine La Motte I went\nto school in a log house for 'bout two months.\n\n\n\"Dey would whip with a cat-o'-nine-tails and den mop de sores with salt\nwater to make it sting. De traders would come through and buy up slaves\nin groups like stock. On de way south dey would have regular stopping\nplaces like pens and coops for de slaves to stay in; at each of these\nstoppin' places some of de slaves would be sold. My uncle's father was\nhis master and de master sold my uncle who was his own son.\n\n\n\"When my mother died I did not know what a coffin was or what death was.\nSo I went to my dead mother where she was on de cooling board and\nbrushed my dress and said, 'Look at my pretty dress.'\n\n\n\"There was a tough gang called patrollers. Dey would scare de Negroes\nand would keep dem always afraid. De mistress would take a couple of us\nyoung ones to church but when we got home things were different.\n\n\n\"And I never seen so many soldiers in my life before or since than when\nPrice come through on his raid. It was apple pickin' time and de\nmistress made us gather apples and pack 'em to the soldiers and we had\nto pack water from de spring to 'em. De mistress had pickets out in\nfront of de house when de soldiers was in town.\n\n\n\"Once when de Union soldiers was in town a negro soldier come and got\nhim a turkey off de fence.

I got two boys here. One is workin' for\nde factory in Crystal City. De other one knows lots about cement. I got\nanother child in New York. They don't write to me. I can't read or\nwrite. Dere was no school for niggers dem days. I has to make a cross\nmark every time I do anything. I went to school one week and my mother\nhad to clean tiff to make a livin' for dem children and get grub so I\nhad to go to work. I had about seven sisters and brothers altogether. I\ndone worked at everything--steamboating, cutting wheat in Harrisonville,\nIllinois. I was here when dis was all woods, man. Me and a saloon keeper\nhave been here a long time, more'n 50 years I guess. I pay $5 a month\nrent or just what I can give 'em. My two boys lives here with me now and\nI get $12 pension.\n\n\n\"Dat's when my old master run when dem blue jackets come. Dey made me\nkill chickens and turkeys and cook for 'em. De lieutenant and sergeant\nwould be right dere. De master would go out in de woods and hide and not\ncome out till they rung de bell at de house.\n\n\n\"I voted since I been 21. I voted for Roosevelt twice. Some thinks he is\ngoin' to get in again. What's the use of takin' money from a man for\nvotin' a certain way? If I like you and you have treated me good all my\nlife den I'll vote for you.\n\n\n\"I don't know what I think about de young Negroes today. Dey is all\nshined up and goin' 'round. If dey can read and write dey ought to know\nde difference between right and wrong. I don't think dey will amount to\nmuch. Some of 'em ain't got no sense. My mother would not let me stay\nout. Now, dat is all dey doin'. Last night de policeman put a knot on my\nboy's head; he was drinkin' and got into it with a coon. De young\ncolored people is fightin' all de time. I don't get out. Just go to de\nstore and come back home again. Dere is a house right near where dey has\na big time every night. De whites and black ones was mixed up here till\nI stopped it. Right down in dat hollow I'll bet you'll find one-third\nwhite women livin' with black men. Most all de colored people around\nhere is workin' in the works here at Crystal City. Dey will get up a war\nhere if they keep on, you just watch, like they did in Illinois when dey\nburnt up a heap of coons. It's liable to get worse de way dey is goin'\non.\"",

She lives with a granddaughter,\nGenevieve Holden, 2627 Thomas Street, St. Louis.\n\n\nLying ill in a three-quarter metal bed in the front hall room of her\ngranddaughter's 4-room brick apartment, the old lady is a very cheerful\nperson, with an exceptionally fair complexion. Her brown hair is mixed\nwith gray and she wears it quite long. Her room is neatly furnished.\n\n\n\"I was born in Gallatin County, Kentucky, more than ninety years ago,\nslaves didn't know dere age in them days when I come along. I do know I\nwas born in July and my mammy's name was Patsy Lillard. I don't know\nnothing at all about no kind of father. Course, I had one but who he was\nI never knew. I ain't never even seen my mother enough to really know\nher, 'cause she was sold off the plantation where I was raised, when I\nwas too young to remember her, and I just growed up in the house with\nthe white folks dat owned me. Dere names was Dave Lillard. He owned more\ndan one hundred slaves. He told me dat my mother had seven children and\nI was de baby of 'em all and de onliest one living dat I knows anything\nabout. They sold my mother down de river when I was too young to\nrecollect a mother. I fared right well with my white masters. I done all\nde sewing in de house, wait on de table, clean up de house, knit and\npick wool, and my old miss used to carry me to church with her whenever\nshe went. She liked lots of water, and I had to bring her water to her\nin church. I had so much temper dey never bothered me none about nursing\nde children. But I did have a heap of nursing to do with de grown ups.\n\n\n\"I used to get a whipping now and den but nothing like de other slaves\ngot. I used to be scared to death of those old Ku Klux folks with all\ndem hoods on dere heads and faces. I never will forget, I saw a real old\ndarkey woman slave down on her knees praying to God for his help. She\nhad a Bible in front of her. Course she couldn't read it, but she did\nknow what it was, and she was prayin' out of her very heart, until she\ndrawed the attention of them old Ku Klux and one of 'em just walked in\nher cabin and lashed her unmerciful. He made her get up off her knees\nand dance, old as she was. Of course de old soul couldn't dance but he\njust made her hop around anyhow.\n\n\n\"De slave owners in de county where I was raised--de well-to-do ones I\nmean, did not abuse de slaves like de pore trash and other slave holders\ndid. Of course dey whipped 'em plenty when dey didn't suit. But dey kind\nof taken care of 'em to sell. Dey had a great slave market dere dat\ndidn't do nothing but sell slaves, and if dey wanted a good price for\ndem de slave would have to be in a purty good condition. Dat's what\nsaved dere hides. My owners had a stock farm and raised de finest stock\nin Kentucky. Dey didn't raise any cotton at all, but dey shore did raise\nfine wheat, barley and corn, just acres and acres of it. De worse\nlashing our slaves ever got was when dey got caught away from home\nwithout a pass. Dey got whipped hot and heavy den.\n\n\n\"In Arkansas many of de slave owners would tie dere slaves to a wagon\nand gallop 'em all over town and would dey be banged up. I saw a strange\nniggah come to town once and didn't know where he was going and stepped\nin the door of a white hotel. When he saw all white faces, he was scared\nmost to death. He didn't even turn around he just backed out and don't\nyou know dem white folks kilt him for stepping inside a white man's\nhotel by mistake, yes they did.\n\n\n\"I can't tell you any pleasure I had in my early days, honey, 'cause I\ndidn't have none. If I had my studyin' cap on, and hadn't just got over\ndis terrible sick spell, I could think of lots of things to tell you,\nbut I can't now. Right after de war dey sent colored teachers through de\nSouth to teach colored people and child, do you know, dem white folks\njust crucified most of 'em. I don't know how to read or write. Never did\nknow. I am de mother of five children, but dey is all dead now. I have\ntwo grandchildren living, and have been in St. Louis seven years. I come\nhere from Helena, Arkansas. My husband was a saloon keeper and a barber.\nHe died in 1880 in Brinkley, Arkansas. I nursed and cooked in Brinkley\nafter he died for fifteen years for one family.\n\n\n\"I wears glasses sometime. I have been a member of de church over fifty\nyears. My membership is in Prince of Peace Baptist Church now and has\nbeen every since I been in St. Louis. God has been so good to me, to let\nme live all dese years. I just want to be ready to meet him when he is\nready for me. My only trouble will be to love white folks, dey have\ntreated my race so bad. My pastor, Rev. Fred McDonald always tells me I\nwill have to forgive them and love dem if I wants to go to heaven. But\nhoney, dat's goin to be a lifetime job. I don't care how long God lets\nme live, it will still be a hard job.\n\n\n\"I gets an old age pension. It is very little, but I thank God for dat.\nI have nothing left to do now in this world but to pray. Thank God for\nhis goodness to me and be ready when He comes.\n\n\n\"Dis rheumatism serves me so bad I can't be happy much.

        "text": "_Peter Tells How Slavery Began_\n\n\n\"I'se 83 years old and was born in Ste. Genevieve County and my old\nslave-time place was in New Tennessee about 14 miles west of de town of\nSte. Genevieve. My master had only my mother, my mother's brother, and\nan old lady by de name of Malinda. My mother had six children but only\nfour of us lived to be grown. Father was owned by a Mr. Aubushon right\ndere at Coffman. Mother come from way south in Kentucky and she was\nowned by a Master Calvin dere and when him and de mistress died de\nslaves had to be divided up among de children. Den my mother's mistress\nleft Louisville and brought her here to Missouri. When mother come to\nMissouri she was only 9 years old.\n\n\n\"My old mistress, I can't say a hard word about her. Before I was borned\nshe was left a widow and she treated us almost like white folks. She\ntook care of us and raised us up. Mother died after she had six children\nand we was left in de care of dis old mistress. The Catholic people\ntreated us like as if we was free. My mother and father was married by\nde priest and it was lawful. But dese other ones was married by de\nmaster hisself. When dey married de master could pick up any old kind of\npaper and call it lawfully married. An almanac or anything would do. But\nwhat was it? The colored people didn't know A from B and wasn't allowed\nto learn to read. If my master or mistress would see me readin' a paper\ndey would come up and say, 'What you know about reading a paper? Throw\ndat down.' Dis was done to keep us from learnin' to read anything.\n\n\n\"After we got free what did we do to get lawfully married to our\nslave-time wife? Understand good now. Den de squire came around and we\nhad to get married all over again under de new constitution. It would\ncost $5. When de master first married us he would say in de ceremony\nsomething like dis:\n\n\n\"'Now, by God, if you ain't treatin' her right, by God, I'll take you up\nand whip you.' The girl's mistress would chastise her de same way. I\nwould choose who I wanted to marry but I had to talk to my master about\nit. Den him and de owner of de girl I wanted would get together and talk\nit over.\n\n\n\"Dere is lots of people right today who can't tell you how de new\nconstitution come up. In slave time, young man, we was stock, like\ncattle and hogs. If I killed 50 men nothin' was said about jail, but we\ngot whipped den. Dat was your sufferin' for what you done done. Man, I\nnever got but one whippin' from my master. I can tell you just how it\ncome. It was done through takin' care of an old cow. Now, in dem times,\nson, dere was not gates like dere is now. You called dem 'slip bars',\nand would let down a rail fence called bars to let the cattle in.\nUnderstand, listen at it good now. Every mornin' I had to go up to de\nstraw stack and drive de cows to de barn. To milk dem we had to drive\ndem down a lane to de house for de old cook woman to milk. As I drove\ndese cows dey all got through de gate but when de last cow come through\nshe fell over de bottom rail and de master was standin' at de window and\nsaw dis happen. De snow was about three feet deep. Now listen good. De\nold master was crippled and so here he come with a walkin' stick in one\nhand and a cowhide in de other.\n\n\n\"He said, 'By God, I'm goin' to learn you, by God, how to let down\nbars'. I said, 'Marster Jim, I let down every bar 'cept dat one on de\nbottom'. He jumped on me and got me down in dat snow till I couldn't see\nhim at all. Every time he raised up an' come down with dat cowhide it\ncut through de snow and hit me. I didn't had nuthin' on 'cept an old\npair of socks around my feet. You know if you was raised from birth like\ndis you could stand it. It come to me, I thought dat if I ever get to be\na man I would pay de marster back for dat.\n\n\n\"And so after dat when we got free I was growin' on 13 years of age. My\naunt and brothers come and got me. My old master was a shoemaker, and\none day my uncle told me to take a pair of boots and take dem over to\nhave half-soled. I taken dem over. I had not come across the old master\nsince de time we was free until dis day. But when I went in de house de\nfamily was around dere and I forgot about payin' him back for de way he\ndone treated me. Jim's mother who was dere said, 'Well, Peter, don't you\nwish you was back here livin' with us again?' I said, 'No, mam.' Den I\nwent in de kitchin and talked to Jim's wife. She was a Republican and\nsaid, 'Wasn't dat hateful what she said about you bein' back here\nagain?' De next time I met my old master, Mr. Galvin, was on de road. He\nwas walkin' and could hardly drag. I was ridin' my horse and thought\nabout gettin' down and whippin' him but when I looked at him I thought I\nmight as well be whippin' a year old child. I let him go.\n\n\n\"Later on Jim got poor and one day I met him at de saloon in Staabtown.\nHe wanted to get some leather from another store. He asked me if he\ncould have my horse. I said rather sharp, 'No, I won't.' Den I thought\nand said, 'Mr. Jim, I'll go and get de leather myself.' So I got de\nleather and taken it to his home and set it in on de porch by his door.\nDen he said, 'Peter, I thank you a thousand times. Any time you need\nanything in de shoe line come to me.'\n\n\n\"Later on he was down and out and he come to his sisters. Dey could not\ntake care of him so dey put him in de asylum in Farmington. I met him in\nFarmington on lots of days, and felt like payin' him back for dat\nwhippin'. But just looked like every time, God would say, 'No, don't do\ndat. He will pay for dat. He will come down'. And he sure did pay for\nit. He died in de asylum out from Farmington. I never mentioned about\ndat whippin' to Jim Galvin, not a nary time.\n\n\n\"When I was freed I felt like I was goin' into a new world. It was de\ndaughter of de old mistress what told me I was as free as dey was. It\nwas dangerous around de house durin' of de war. So de old mistress broke\nup de old place and us boys was given to our godmother. Mary was my\ngodmother and it was here I was told dat I was free. We was little and\ndidn't know which way to go. My mistress said, 'Now Peter, you are free\nand de first chance we get we are going to send for your aunt to come\nand get you.' Dere were four of us brothers bein' taken care of by four\nsisters, when we was free. My uncle was in de army and served two years\nand had come home. He asked my aunt, 'Where are dose boys?' My aunt\nsaid, 'Dey is still with de white folks.' So my uncle come to get us.\nWhen he come he rid up and we was so glad to see him we run out and met\nhim. He said, 'Boys, I've come after you.'\n\n\n\"We walked up to de house. Den de white folks was just as glad to see\nUncle Julius as if he had been their brother. Den Uncle Julius said to\nmy godmother, Mary, 'Well, Miss Evely, I come after Pete.' She said,\n'Julius, I'm awful glad you've come to get him, I hate to give him up,\nbut take him and take good care of him.' Julius was told de same thing\nby all de other godmothers of my brothers. All of dese sisters had de\nwinter clothes for us cut out but dey wasn't made. De white women said,\n'All your aunt has to do is to make dem.' We had between nine and ten\nmiles to go to get down to my aunt's home.\n\n\n\"My aunt's husband was freed at least 15 years before de war started.\nHis master died and he was freed by a will when the master went to de\ncourt house in Ste. Genevieve. Now, just listen good. Dis master willed\n800 acres to his slaves who divided up de farm. Before he died, he put\nit down in a way dat his daughters and sons-in-laws could not break it\n'cepting dey would raise several thousand dollars. De old slaves would\nsit down and tell us about it. De master turns in and pays de taxes up\nfor 100 years. One of de trustees for de will was a Dr. Herdick and\nHenry Rozier both of Ste. Genevieve. My uncle's part was 40 acres and it\nwas dis farm where I went when I come out from under de shelter of de\nwhite folks. De colored would sell 2 or 3 acres at a time and all dis\nfarm is now sold. I was 13 when I got free and went to dis farm and\nthere was my home until I was right at a grown man. De only taxes we had\nto pay was on household goods and stock. Every year when de personal\ntaxes come due I would go into Ste. Genevieve to pay de taxes. As long\nas Dr. Herdick and Henry Rozier lived as overseers we was well protected\non de farm. But Ed Rozier, a lawyer, tried to get us to pay de other\nkind of taxes.\n\n\n\"I was goin' on 20 or 21 before I left de farm. De old lady and Uncle\ndied about de same time. Dey took de old lady to de River Aux Vases\nCatholic Church to bury her and I stayed with de old man and he died\nbefore dey got back from de funeral. We sold our forty acres and dere\nwas six heirs. Den I went to work on a farm of Mr. Aubushon for $10 a\nmonth for 15 years. When I quit Aubushon I went den out in Washington\nCounty at Potosi and stayed with my two uncles out dere. I served in a\niron factory dere for about two years. Sometimes I would get $5 a day.\nDen when de price would fall off I would get less. Den I come back to\nSte. Genevieve County and worked by de day and den went to St. Louis. I\nworked dere from one iron factory to another and so den I quit dat.\n\n\n\"Den I 'run the river' three straight years from St. Louis to Cairo and\nMemphis, and Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. I den quit de down trade and\nrested up and made de northern trip from St. Louis to St. Paul.\nEverything had to be sent from de South out to California. Dat boat had\nnothin' on it 'cept eatin' things. So my aim was to get out to\nCalifornia to dig gold. I got defeated in dis way.\n\n\n\"De river got so low dat we would be tied up for 3 or 4 days before we\ncould unload it. And we never made it to de port where we could unload\nit to send it to California. From dese ports you went by land with a\ncovered wagon and oxen or mules. It would sometimes take 6 months to get\nto California from de time we left de river. My way would have been free\nbecause I could drive a team out to California. But I never got to go\n'cause de river got so low. I quit de river work and done some farming\nfor first one den another down in Ste. Genevieve County for a couple of\nyears.\n\n\n\"Dey was just startin' up at Crystal City. Dere was lots in de paper\nabout it. Now and den William Kimer, who was livin' in Jefferson County,\nwrote me to work for him. I would work for him from May to December\ndurin' de wheat cuttin', thrashing, corn pullin' and wheat sowin'. Den\ndere was no more summer work, so Crystal City was just startin' up and\ndere was no railroad and dey got everything by boat and teams hauled de\nthings from de river up to de plant. Sometimes there was from 50 to 60\nfarm teams down at de river haulin' de coal, brick, etc. for de company.\nSometimes we would make $15 a day for de farmer man and he would pay me\n$10 a month and board. Den I went to Crystal City and worked 13 straight\nyears. De most dat ever I got dere was five or six dollars a day. Dis\nwould be about every three months w'en we tore down de furnace and built\nit back. At other times I would get about $4.50 a day. I done\neverything. Made mortar, carried de hod and brick and when quittin' time\ncome you was tired. After I quit Crystal City I went down in Ste.\nGenevieve County and farmed and got married and had two children. My\nwife and one child, a little girl, is dead. I live here with my son and\nhis wife. My son has been workin' for de St. Joe here for 12 or 13\nyears. I had to quit work when I lost my eye-sight.\n\n\n\"I was grubbin' hazel-nut bushes in dem rich bottoms in Ste. Genevieve\nCounty; and one day I was runnin' and fell down on a stob and it went\nthrough my left eye. Dis happened about 40 years ago. De other eye was\ngood till I was 45 and den I had de loss of both eyes and been blind\never since. I'se been gettin' a blind pension for 22 years. It is $75\nevery three months.\n\n\n\"Dere is only one colored family here dat owns their house. All de\nothers rent from the company. I vote at every presidential election, but\ndat's about all I ever do vote. I been votin' for every president\nelection since I was 21 years old. From de beginning to de end it's\nalways the same, the Republican ticket. Dey joke me a good deal around\nhere 'bout voting one way.\n\n\n\"As I look back on it, people ought never to have been slaves. Dat was\nthe low downest thing dat ever was. De first startin' of slavery was\nwhen a white man would go over to Africa and de people over dere was\nignorant and de white man would hold up a pretty red handkerchief and\ntrade it for one of de Negro women's children. De Negroes in Africa was\ntoo ignorant to know better and dis is de way slavery started. I always\nsaid like dis, when de older ones that knowed de things, dey ought have\nlearned de slaves their names as dey was in Africa. Lots of us don't\nknow what our grandparents was in Africa. Slavery didn't teach you\nnothin' but how to work and if you didn't work your back would tell it.\nSlavery taught you how to lie, too. Just like your master would tell you\nto go over and steal dat hog. Den de other master from who I stole de\nhog would say, 'Peter, why I've lost a hog; did you ever see him\nanywhere?' I would say, 'No, suh'. Of course if I did not lie I would\nget a whippin'.\n\n\n\"De white people did not want to put us in a state to ourselves after de\nfreedom 'cause dey couldn't do without us. De colored people done come\nup too high now to back 'em and dey got a better chance. De conditions\nnow of de colored people is of course better now 'cause dey is somebody.\nBut every day dey is tryin' to starve us out and give de white man a job\non de state road. Dey do dat to keep us down. Dat's done more now dan\never before. It's been worse since Roosevelt got in dere. When Highway\n61 was put in from St. Louis down to Festus de colored man had a part to\ndo. Since Roosevelt got in dey won't even let a colored man walk down de\nhighway.\"",

He is Ed\nCraddock, born a few years before the Civil War, the son of slaves owned\nby leading pioneer families. Craddock lived through the hard days of\nreconstruction. His own father was a school building janitor in Marshall\nin the 1870's, and Ed Craddock was apprenticed under his sire, finally,\nupon death of the latter, succeeding to the job, which he has held for\nforty-seven years. Years ago he married and reared a large family.\nCraddock belongs to the Methodist Church, serving as \"second\nminute-man\", which he explains is something like a secretary, and also\nbelongs to the Colored Masonic Lodge. Craddock's brother is a practicing\nphysician in St. Louis.\n\n\n\"Stories told me by my father are vivid,\" Craddock said in an interview.\n\"One especially, because of its cruelty. A slave right here in Marshall\nangered his master, was chained to a hemp-brake on a cold night and left\nto freeze to death, which he did. My father said slaves had to have a\npass to go places. 'Patrollers' usually went in groups of three. If they\ncaught a slave off his plantation without a pass the patrollers often\nwould flog them.\"\n\n\nCraddock relates that his father suffered from chills and fever which,\nquinine, the only remedy known then, failed to cure. Someone advised\nhim, next time the chill came on, to plunge into a deep and cold hole in\nthe river. Ed says his father, out of desperation, tried the suggested\ncure, and it worked, in a way squaring with the modern medical theory of\nsetting up a counterirritant in certain cases.\n\n\nCraddock's mother was owned by the family of Marmadukes, one of whom was\nan early-day governor of Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsabelle Daniel [TR: Mrs. Eli Daniel]\n\n\n\n\n    *Interview with Mrs. Eli Daniel,*\n    *Marshall, Missouri.*\n\n\nAn aged negress answered the door when I knocked and asked if this was\nIsabelle, she invited me into her parlor, a tiny room with a rather\ngood-looking brussels rug upon the floor, and panel lace curtains hung\nat the windows. The walls were hung with enlarged crayon pictures of\nIsabelle's husband and their sons and daughters; no other pictures adorn\nthe walls. The center is the old family Bible occupying the place of\nhonor; all the births, deaths, and marriages of the family have been\ncarefully recorded in this book. An album holds next place and contains\nmany old fashioned pictures of her \"white folks\" and friends of her\nyounger days.\n\n\nThe outside of this little four room house is quite attractive, it was\nformerly painted white, but not much paint clings to it now; old\nfashioned green shutters still hang at the windows, a tiny little\nportico shelters the front door.

She also was a\nnursemaid for her mistress' little children and at one time was hired\nout to the methodist preacher's family to take care of the children when\nhis wife was ill.\n\n\nShe remembered joining the \"white folks\" methodist church in old\nCambridge and going to church on Sundays and sitting in the Gallery,\nwhich was the place reserved for colored people in that particular\nplace.\n\n\nOn Sunday morning Aunt Cindy got \"happy\" at the services and began to\nthrow herself about and shout; the white folks on the seats below\nhurried to get out from under the edge of the balcony for fear Aunt\nCindy would lose her balance and fall over the railing to the floor\nbelow.\n\n\nIsabelle is a Firm Believer in \"hants.\"\n\n\nWhen she was a girl the adjoining plantation was owned by her master's\nbrother-in-law, and on this plantation was the big old tobacco factory\nwhere the tobacco raised on several neighboring plantations was priced\nand hung. The negroes on her master's place said this factory was\n\"hanted.\" None of them would go near this factory after nightfall, for\n\"when the nights were still and the moon was full, you could hear the\nting, ting, ting, of the lever all night long and voices of the slaves\ncrying out and complaining, and you knew there wasn't anybody there at\nall, jest hants.\"\n\n\nIsabelle was a mid-wife by profession after the war, and tells this as\none of her experiences.\n\n\nShe was caring for a lady that had just had her second child; they lived\nin a cottage with a full basement under it.\n\n\nThe father was to take full care of the other child, a little boy, at\nnight, and they were to sleep in the basement. The father and little son\ntried to sleep in the basement for two or three nights, but the father\ncould not sleep. Something bothered him as if restless spirits were\nabroad. One morning Isabelle said she was standing by the door when she\nheard a voice, low and vibrant, saying, \"No sleep here. Can't sleep\nhere.\" No one was there but her and the mother and the two little\nchildren, so, of course, she knew it was \"hants\". This was proved to her\nsatisfaction a few months later. The skeleton of a man was found under\nthe basement floor.",

He is about one hundred and five years old,\nin possession of all his faculties and is able to move around the house.\nHe seemed to have only hazy recollections, and it was difficult to keep\nhim from wandering from the subject. The following is the story that he\ntold:\n\n\n\"I was married and had three children when we was freed. The only slaves\nMr. Kendrick had was my mother, brother, sister, and myself. Mr.\nKendrick had three boys. Joe carried mail to Paris, and de other two,\nBob and Jerome, was school teachers.\n\n\n\"We was treated fair when we behaved ourselves, but we had to be\nstraightened out sometimes but we were not mistreated. We worked hard on\nde farm. I cradled wheat and plowed corn often till midnight. We often\ndrove hogs to Palmyra and Hannibal. When dere was no crops in de fields\nwe made brooms and baskets. My brother died and den I had to do most of\nde work. I was de only colored man on de place den. De Stage stopped at\nMr. Kendrick's place and I had to look after de horses and mules. De\nmail come dere too, and dere was always a lot of people to be fed.\n\n\n\"Mr. Kendrick was judge of de court at New London and he was away most\nof de time. He was a big man in de county in dem days, and I had to go\nto town often. Once when I was driving to town with de ox team and wagon\nduring de war, dere was soldiers on de road like you never did see. I\ntell you dem was bad times. I come back a different road because I was\nafraid, and I run dem oxen most of de way home. I got dere all right,\nbut de oxen laid down on me once. De next morning one of the oxen was\ndead and in about a week de other one died. Dey just couldn't stand de\nrunning.\n\n\n\"Two of de master's boys got locked up over in New London or some place\nduring de war. Dey come back after the war was over.\n\n\n\"I played a fiddle for all de weddings and parties in de neighborhood.\nDey paid me fifteen or twenty cents each time and I had money in my\npockets all de time.\n\n\n\"When we was set free dey gave us a side of meat and a bushel of meal.\nDat's all we got. I went on a farm and farmed for myself, later I owned\na farm in Ralls County. We raised corn and pigs and drove de pigs to\nHannibal and Palmyra. When I got too old to farm I come here to live\nwith my daughter. I get a pension now for about a year. It's not very\nmuch but it helps.\"",

She lives at\n8004 Elinore Avenue, St. Louis County, Missouri, with her son and\ndaughter-in-law.\n\n\nHer home is an old fashioned 3-room slate dwelling, with an abundance of\nold furniture for such a small place. The little old woman was\ninterviewed while mending the pockets in her son's trousers. Her story\nfollows:\n\n\n\"I was born May 24, 1852 in Carroll County, Tennessee. My mother's name\nwas Mary Whitehorn, 'cause she was owned by de Whitehorns in dat county.\nMy father's name was James Farrow 'cause he was owned by de Farrows. De\nslaves had to carry dere owners' names, married or what not. My mother\nhad three children. My first owner's name was George Whitehorn and his\nwife's was Jackie Whitehorn. When old Marse George died, we was handed\ndown to Joseph Whitehorn in Miss Jackie's will. She knowed long before\nfreedom we were going to be free, so she had in her will dat her\ndarkies,--she always called us darkies--had caused dem to have all dey\nowned and it was no more dan right when we git free to divide up de\nplantation so every one of us could make a good livin' on de livin' we\ndone made for dem, and dey still own and have plenty. She was a good old\nsoul. She didn't want a one of us to leave, even after freedom been\ndeclared. She said she would never live to see it and she didn't\nneither. She died 'fore we was free, and dem chillun never did carry out\nher will neither.\n\n\n\"'Cause dey didn't give a one of us nothin', no, nothin' at all. Put us\nout wid just what we had on our backs, and dat was most nothin'. At 4\nyears old I had to nurse old man George's son, Joseph's baby, and de\nbaby was most big as me, but I nursed it just de same, honey. Dey put me\nin dat family nursin' dat baby 'fore I was four 'cause dey put me dere\nin January and I wasn't four years old till de incoming May dat same\nyear. I 'member dat right well. I nursed dat baby for two years, too,\nand it sure was crazy 'bout me. I loved it too, yes, I did. Den after\ntwo years dey sent me to work for de old man's oldest son, Jacob. Dey\nmade me do all de cardin' and spinnin', make ropes and ply lines, two\ncuts a day, was my task and I stayed dere in dat family until after the\nCivil War was over.\n\n\n\"I heard my father got killed in de Civil War. I never knowed for sure,\n'cause three months 'fore I was born, his owners carried him away to\nsome other part of de country and we never seen nor heard from him no\nmore. Mother never did know what happened him, no she didn't.\n\n\n\"Just 'fore war was declared I was still young and small but just de\nsame I had to help pack brick to de moulders where dey would be building\nbrick chimneys, and work in de field, too. I had it mighty hard in dem\ndays, yes I did but den it wasn't hard as some others had it.\n\n\n\"I 'member during de war days, my old miss use to boast 'bout her\nlittlest darkey, done spun enough thread to clothe her whole family for\nde next three years to come. For two years after freedom was declared I\nworked from farm to farm and de promise we was going to get paid, but we\nnever got nothin' from none of dat work but de old slave cabin to sleep\nin and food enough just so we could work.\n\n\n\"We had noboby down in dat country to make folks keep dere word and pay\na nigger, so we just have to keep on travelin'. After 'bout three years\nlater I cooked in de same county for a Bill Green. Got my board and keep\nand $1.00 a week. He kept me 'bout five months. Dey never did keep us\nlong for pay. Den I went to John Carney's plantation wid my mamma. I\ncard and spun dere for 'bout one year and some weeks. We got $1.00 a\nweek and he was supposed to give us home made cloth to make us some\nclothes for our work, but he never did do it. After dat we went to work\non Sub Allen's farm for $1.00 week. I took sick dere and dey had to call\nin a doctor. My mamma and me worked for him a long time, but we got\nready to go and want our money he said, while I was sick it taken all he\nowed us to pay my doctor's bill so we didn't git nothin' dere, but a\nplace to stay and we shore did work like slaves in all dem places, from\nsun up till sun down just like in slave days. Only difference was we\ndidn't git a beatin' when we didn't suit. I couldn't make no money for\nclothes or nothing so I just up and married and had eleven children. Den\nmy husband died. I had a child in dis last World War. He was my ninth\nchild and got took in de last draft. I never heard of him no more. Dis\none I'm living with named Ulysses Divine. He's de only child I got\nliving I know anything about.\n\n\n\"I been here in St. Louis since Wilson's first administration and worked\nin de nut factory five years. I like to sew and do general housework. I\nread, write and spell a little but not enough to speak about. I know dis\nyoung generation's got a mighty fine chance if dey 'cept of it and\n'preciate it. Course some do and some don't. I prefer living in town dan\nout here but my son bought dis spot. I can't make my own living no more,\nso I got to live on it. I git what de relief pretend to call help,\n'tain't nuff for nothin' though. Dey claim I'll git a pension, but I\nnever seen it yet. I'll be dead directly and I won't need it. I can't\nanswer dem other questions 'bout what us slaves expect and voting, I\ndon't know.\"",

All the work was done by\nhand. The slaves cradled the wheat. They raised hemp for clothes. The\nold master had one woman who made clothes the year round for the hands.\nWe had to get a pass from the master to leave the place. If any of the\nslaves got in trouble they were taken to the whippin' post. If they had\ndone a big crime they got 60 or 70 lashes with a whip, for a small crime\nthey got about thirty, if their master would not pay their fine. The\nwhite folks went to singin' school then they would sing one or two songs\nthat's all they knew. They would have big basket meetings. All the\nslaves had to set in the gallery when we went to church. Most everybody\nwent on hossback. Some of the farmers were good to their men and some\nbad. When some farm had more slaves than was needed, he would hire them\nout to some body or sell them. New Year's day was always sale day or the\nday they would hire out for the year. When we wanted to get married we\nhad to ask the master and the girls' mother and father. All the married\nman got Thursday night off to go to see their wives.\n\n\n\"At Christmas time we got a week off and we got Saturday afternoon off.\nAt Christmas the old boss would fix a big bowl of eggnog for us niggers.\nThe niggers were superstitious. They would not live in a house where a\nsinner had died. There was an old man and woman lived down the road from\nour house that fit all the time, and by that house after dark one night\none saw them walkin' around in the house. None of us niggers would go by\nthere after dark, we always rode around the place.

Solomon Eulenberg was my father\nand he was a big fine looking man. My mother come fum Tennessee when she\nwas ten year old.\n\n\n\"Master had nearly a hundred slaves and dey was about ten or twelve\ncabins in de quarters. Dey was a big feeding barn where we'd hitch up\nand go to work. De barn was built of big hewed logs, too.\n\n\n\"No'm, dey wasn't none of us ever try to run away. We had a good home\nand we all stayed till dey declare peace and lots of us kept on a\nstaying 'cause we didn't know nothing else to do. But my father was\nindustrious--he worked hard and saved his money and in a couple of year\nhe bought a team and we moved to a little place.\n\n\n\"But lots of de cullud folks had it hard dem days--dey was jest turned\nloose and didn't know what to do. Some of de white folks was mighty good\nto 'em. If they'd hear of a family being hungry dey'd send food to 'em\nor have 'em come to dey kitchen.\n\n\n\"A cose mebbe it don't sound right but in some ways I often wish we's\nback in dem days. We had a fine place. Every year we'd kill seventy or\nseventy-five hogs--and had plenty of every thing. We ate our meals in\nour own cabin but every morning at seven, de colored housewoman went to\nde smoke house to cut meat for de day. Us youngsters all ganged up round\nher, hoping to get something. Lotsa times missus would ask us if we's\nhungry and bring us into de kitchen and give us what dey had left.\nSometime she have de women make up pancakes for us.

She lives in a rear\napartment of the slum district at 1405 North Eighth Street with her\ndaughter, Eliza Grant.\n\n\nAnn declares she's had eleven children of her own and that from them\nhave sprung so many grand children and great grand children that she's\nentirely lost count of them. The story of the incidents that have filled\nher life but have still left her able to love mankind and smile follows\nsubstantially in her own words:\n\n\n\"I was born March 10, 1843 on Dolphin Street, Mobile, Alabama. My\nmother's name was Charlotte Ulrich and my father's was Peter Pedro\nUlrich. I am the mother of 11 children and we has over 100\ngrandchildren. Dere is so many great grandchildren and great great\ngrandchildren we jes' quit countin' when we comes to dem. I has four\ngenerations, and dey give me a party three years ago, and so many of my\noff spring come der wasn't any room for half of 'em and even dat was not\nde beginning of de lot of 'em. I got a gang of 'em I never did see, and\nnever will see, I don't reckon. Dey just write and tell us dey got 'em.\n\n\n\"My father was owned by a rich old boss named Captain Bullmay. He owned\na raft of boats, and my father was a cook on one of dem boats. Mamma\nonly raised two of her children. De Ulriches sold me when I was a girl\nto Dr. Odem in de same county, and I worked in his field, spun thread to\nmake cloth, pulled fodder, put de spinning in, and after a while, I\ndon't know how long, he swapped me off for two boys. My new owner was\nGilbert Faulkner. He was a railroad section man. I worked in de field\nfor him until we was set free. I had some good times and some bad times\nboth. De man I married worked on the railroad for him. His name was\nMoses Evans. Dat was in Helena, Arkansas. My husband's been dead more\ndan 30 years now. I got four daughters and three sons living and a host\nof grand and great grand, and great great grandchildren living. Since my\nhusband died, I just live from one child to the other and some time de\ngrandchildren takes care of me, I havn't done no kind of work since my\nchildren got big enough to work. Dey been pretty good to me all my days.\n\n\n\"'Bout a year ago de government done started giving me a pension, $11 a\nmonth. It helps some, but don't very much, every thing's so high, honey.\nWhen freedom come I asked my old owner to please let me stay on wid dem,\nI didn't have no whar to go no how. So he just up and said, 'Ann, you\ncan stay here if you want to, but I ain't goin' to give you nothing but\nyour victuals and clothes enough to cover your hide, not a penny in\nmoney, do no nigger get from me.' So I up and said, 'Why boss, dey tells\nme dat since freedom we git a little change', and he cursed me to all de\nlow names he could think of and drove me out like a dog. I didn't know\nwhat to do, or where to go, so I sauntered off to a nearby plantation\nwhere a colored slave kept house for her bachelor slave owner and she\nlet me stay with her, and her boss drove me off after two days, because\nI kept company with a nigger who worked for a man he didn't like. I was\nbarefooted, so I asked Moses Evans, to please buy me some shoes, my feet\nwas so sore and I didn't have no money nor no home neither. So he said\nfor me to wait till Saturday night and he'd buy me some shoes. Sure\n'nough when Saturday night come, he buyed me some shoes, and\nhandkerchiefs and a pretty string of beads and got an old man neighbor\nnamed Rochel to let me stay at his house. Den in a few weeks me and him\ngot married, and I was mighty glad to marry him to git a place to stay.\nYes I was. 'Cause I had said, hard times as I was having if I seed a man\nwalking with two sticks and he wanted me for a wife I'd marry him to git\na place to stay. Yes I did and I meant just dat. In all my born days I\nnever knowed of a white man giving a black man nothing, no I ain't.\n\n\n\"Now child, let me tell you right here, I was always a heap more scared\nof dem Ku Klux dan I was of anything else. 'Cause de war was to help my\nfolks. But dem old Ku Klux never did mean us no good. Honey, I used to\nmake pallets on de floor after de war for my children, myself and\nhusband to sleep on, 'cause dem Ku Klux just come all around our house\nat night time and shoot in de doors and windows. Dey never bothered\nnobody in de day time. Den some time dey come on in de house, tear up\neverything on de place, claim dey was looking for somebody, and tell us\ndey hungry 'cause dey ain't had nothin' to eat since de battle of\nShiloh. Maybe twenty of 'em at a time make us cook up everything we got,\nand dey had false pockets made in dere shirt, and take up de skillet\nwith de meat and hot grease piping hot and pour it every bit down de\nfront of dem shirts inside de false pockets and drop de hot bread right\ndown dere, behind de meat and go on.\n\n\n\"One night dey come to our house after my husband to kill him, and my\nhusband had a dream dey's coming to kill him. So he had a lot of colored\nmen friends to be at our house with guns dat night and time dey seed dem\nKu Klux coming over de hill, dey started shooting just up in de air and\nabout, and dem Ku Klux never did bother our house no more. I sure glad\nof dat. I'se so tired of dem devils. If it hadn't been for dat dey would\nhave killed everyone of us dat night. I don't know how come dey was so\nmean to us colored folks. We never did do nothing to dem.\n\n\n\"Dey go to some of dem niggers' house, and dey run up de chimney corner\nto hide and dem low down hounds shoot 'em and kill 'em in de chimney\nhole. Dey was terrible. Den de next bad thing happened to us poor\nniggers after de war was dis. De white folks would pay niggers to lie to\nde rest of us niggers to git der farming done for nothing. He'd tell us\ncome on and go with me, a man wants a gang of niggers to do some work\nand he pay you like money growing on trees. Well we ain't had no money\nand ain't use to none, so we glad to hear dat good news. We just up and\nbundle up and go with this lying nigger. Dey carried us by de droves to\ndifferent parts of Alabama, Arkansas and Missouri. After we got to dese\nplaces, dey put us all to work all right on dem great big farms. We all\nlight in and work like old horses, thinking now we making money and\ngoing to git some of it, but we never did git a cent. We never did git\nout of debt. We always git through with fine big crops and owed de white\nman more dan we did when we started de crop, and got to stay to pay de\ndebt. It was awful. All over was like dat. Dem lying niggers caused all\ndat. Yes dey did.\n\n\n\"I don't know what to think of this younger generation. 'Pears to me\nlike dey jest ain't no good. Dey is too trifling. I often times tell 'em\ndere chances today side of mine in my day. Dey jest say dey wouldn't\ntake what I been through.\n\n\n\"But dey is just a hopeless lot, just plain no good. All I can say is as\nyou say, some is some good but so few 'ginst de masses, take so long to\nfind 'em, I just don't bother 'bout trying to hunt 'em out.\n\n\n\"I voted once in my life, but dat's been so long ago I don't 'member who\nit was for, or where I was living at de time. I never had no friends in\npolitics to my knowing. All I 'member dey told me to put a cross under\nde elephant, and I did dat. I don't know nothin 'more 'bout it dan dat.\nDon't know what it meant or nothing. After all I been through, honest\nchile, I love everybody in de world, dose dat mistreat me and dose dat\ndidn't. I don't hold nothing in my heart 'ginst nobody, no I don't. God\ngoing to righten each wrong some day, so I'se going to wait with love in\nmy heart till dat day come. Den I speck I will feel plenty sorry, for\nwhat's going to happen to dem dat mistreated me and my people and all\nother helpless folks. 'Cause I seen white folks in my day, have 'bout as\ntough time in a way as black folks, and right now some of 'em fairing\njust 'bout like me.\n\n\n\"I 'member how de old slaves use to be workin' in de field singing 'Am I\nborn to die, And Lay Dis Body Down.' And dey sing, 'Dark was de night\nand cold de ground, on which my lord was laid, Great drops of blood like\nsweat run down, in agony He prayed.' Another song was 'Way over in de\npromised land my Lord calls me and I must go'. And 'On Jordan's Stormy\nBanks I stand, and cast a wishful eye. To Canaan's fair and happy land,\nwhere my possessions lie. All o'er those wide extended plains, Shines\none eternal day; There God, the son forever reigns, And scatters night\naway. No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath, Can reach that healthful\nshore; Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, Are felt and feared no more.\nWhen shall I reach that happy place, And be forever blest? When shall I\nsee my father's face, And in his bosom rest? I am Bound for the Promised\nLand.'\n\n\n\"I am a member of the Sanctified Church. I was a Baptist for years.\"",

Masta' Josiah Mayberry. My mammy carried de\nname Logan 'cause dat wuz de famly she belonged to fo' Masta' bought her\ndown in Buckskull, Arkansas. Masta had three sons, Dosh, his wife wuz\nRoberta, Alf his wife wuz Malissa and Byrd, his wife wuz Cully. In dem\ndays we called 'em all by dere first name. We honored de ole Masta', but\nde younger folks, we didden call Masta' Dosh, or Masta' Byrd--or Missus\nCully. It wuz jes Dosh, Byrd or Cully. I didden' know de ole Missus. Dey\ntole me she went crazy and kilt herself shortly after I wuz borned\n'cause she thought I was white. We wuz de only slave famly Masta' had en\nhe wuz good to us. We all liked him, all o' us but Cynthy, dat's my\nmammy I allus called her Cynthy till after de war wuz over. Cynthy\nalways called him \"Ole Damn\"--she hated him 'cause he brought her fum\nArkansas and left her twins an' dey poppy down dere. Cynthy's daddy was\na full Cherrokee. She wuz always mad and had a mean look in her eye.\nWhen she got her Indian up de white folks let her alone. She usta run\noff to de woods till she git over it. One time she tuk me and went to de\nwoods an' it was nigh a month fore dey found her--and I wuz nigh dead.\nDey kept me at de white folks house till I got strong again. Only one\ntime Masta' whip me. We made lots o' molasses on our place. Oh! lots of\nmolasses en' dey wuz allus some barrels standin' upright wid bungs in\nclose to de bottom so de 'lasses run out. One day I seed one o' de men\nfix him some sweetened tobaccy. He had his tobaccy in a box about so\nbig, en he push de bung des way, en dat way--den down, den up den he\nhol' it jes loose enough so de 'lasses trickle out over his tobaccy. I\nwatched him an thought I'd fix me some, too. I got my box fixed en' I\npushed at de bung, I pushed dis way, en dat way like I seed him do when\nall at once dat bung flew out en' dat lasses flew all over de place. De\nbarrel was full en' it cum out so fast I couldn't git de bung back in. I\ntried till I wuz wadin' in 'lasses to my knees. Den I run call Masta'\nand tell him a bung dun bust out. He say how you do dat? I tell him I\njes knock again' 'en it flew out. Den he seed my box and he knowed how I\ndone it. Den he laid me on de floor an' he put his foot on my haid. He\ntook his switch and he gave me one good out. Den he kept beatin on de\nfloor. I guess dat wuz to make de others think he wuz giving me a big\nbeatin'. But I didden want that big foot on my haid no more.\n\n\n\"De big house stood facing de road. It wuz built like lots o' houses wuz\nin dem days, de kitchen and dinin' room on one side. Masta's room on de\nudder with a big open hallway between. Across de front was a big porch.\nWe called it a gallery. Across de road, back a piece ways wuz our cabin.\nCynthy did all de cookin, an she wuz a good cook. We allus had plenty\ngood things to eat. De white folks would sit down en eat, en when dey's\nthrough we'd sit down at de same table. I 'members de first shoes I ever\nhad. One of de men had got em fo' his little girl, en' dey was too\nsmall. So he giv' 'em to my step-daddy for me. Dey uz too big but I wore\nem en wuz proud of em. They wuz so big fo' me, they went dis way en' dat\nway en' den de heels went all crooked. I wore 'em till 'bout de time de\nfirst snow came den I guess I thought I'd wore 'em long enuf an' I\nthrowed em away. My step daddy whipped me for dat and made me wear 'em\nall winter.\n\n\n\"I must a been 'bout eight year old when de war start. Fust I knowed,\none day Masta said to me. \"Child go out to de gate an see if anyone\ncomin.\" I went to de gate like he tole me an' dere was men comin down de\nroad. Whew! I never seed so many men in all my life. I went back en'\ntole him. He didden' say nuthin' but lit out the back way across the\nfields an we didden see him again fo' some time.\n\n\n\"After that we saw lots o' sojers--dey'd stop at our place but dey never\nbother nuthin. Masta told us allus to have plenty cookin' an bakin'\nready when de sojers came. Cynthy'd have de kitchen cupboard piled full\no' lightbread and cakes and pies--sometime dey's Rebel sojers an\nsometimes dey's Republicans--We called de Northerns Republicans. We cud\nallus tell 'em. The Rebels wore brown coats and the Northerners wore\nblue suits wid pretty gold pieces on dey shoulders. My! but dey wuz\npretty.\n\n\n\"Masta' ud come home once en awhile--an den one day he come home--I can\nsee him yet a-sittin by de kitchen stove. De stove sat back in de big\nfireplace far enuf so de pipe go up de flue but not too far so you could\nlook in de oven. Dere sat de Masta lookin' like he had sumthin' to tell\nmammy but was skeered to. She had her mad up that day--I jes foun' a\nhen's nest an' wuz runnin' in to tell her. I hollered \"Cynthy,\nCynthy\"--Masta' put up his hand en say, slow like--\"Stop chile! You\nmustin' call her Cynthy no more. The war is over and you no more slaves.\nNow you must call her mammy\". But dat all de difference it made--we kep'\non livin dere just de same, till Masta' died two year atter de war.\n\n\n\"One day a mule kicked him on de laig what wuz hurt in de war. It got so\nbad de doctor couldn' do nuthin for it. Masta' wud holler wid pain--It\nwuz in de fall of de year. One day I came in and sed, \"Masta' you know\ndat big yellow apple tree? It's bloomin again, en it's got little green\napples on it.\" He looked at me an sez--'Chile, youre lyin\". I sez, \"No\nMasta I ain't.\" He say \"If you're lyin' to me, I'll get up and lick you\nagain\", so I runs and gets him a branch wid flowers on, and little green\napples, an when he sees it, he cries. He knows he's gonna die 'cause de\ntree is bloomin out of season. But I didden know it. I says \"Masta' if\ndem apples gits ripe, we'll have good eatins''cause de big yellow mealy\nones wen dey fall, dey bust wide open.\"\n\n\n\"Masta' died en if I'd a know'd what I know now I could have saved him.\nI'd a took young elder leaves en boiled em to make a tea--den I'd a\npoured dat in de sore en it ud a got well.\n\n\n\"Masta' musta had hundreds a acres--'cause he give each o' his boys a\nbig farm--en dey was his dotter Caroline, by his fust wife--I forgit\n'bout her--he give her a farm, too--Dis wuz down in Stoddard County,\nnear Advance. Shortly after dat Dosh died, en de rest sold out en' went\nto Texas.\n\n\n\"We seed Masta' lots a times after he died. I sez it wuz Masta' 'cause\nit looked like him. One day I was standin lookin thru de bars o' de gate\nwen I seen out in de road de largest dog I ever seed in all my life. He\nwuz standin' der lookin' at me. I says to my brother, 'Look! he's got\nthick sandy red hair like Masta's, en he's got a nose like Masta's, en\nhe's got eyes like Masta's, an he sho' do look like Masta'--Den I run\nback onto de gallery where de adder folks is. Dat dog stan' dere lookin\nat us, de big brush on his tail jes a wavin', den he reach thru de gate\nwid one paw, en onlatch it, and walked right in. The gate went shut agin\nbut it didden make no noise. Den he cum up de walk en go rite across de\ngallery in front of us. He jump over de side fence, en run across de\nfield, en go inter de woods. We know'd it wuz Masta', jes cum to look\naroun, en it git so he'd cum every day 'bout noon, jes when Masta'\nalways cum in fo' dinner. We ain't never seed him cum outer de\ngraveyard, but he always com frum dat way. En one day I wuz playing in\nde doorway of our cabin an I looked across to de big house, and dere sat\nMasta' in his big chair on de gallery. I called Mammy en she says--'If\nyou're lyin', I'll whup you.' But she cum en look, en she seed him too,\nhe had his white shirt-sleeve rolled up to his elbow and his red flannel\nundershirt sleeve down to his wrist jes like he uster wear it. Der he\nsat en while we wus lookin he got up en walked off around the house.\n\n\n\"I 'members one evenin' 'bout dusk I wuz commin thru de cotton patch,\nan' I run plum into a man crawlin' along--Dat wuz durin' de war, en der\nhe wuz crawlin' on his hands en knees. He had de biggest hands I ever\nseed on a human, an his feet wasn't ever touchin de groun'--dey wuz jes\nfloppin' one over de udder, dis way. An his face!--I've seed false faces\nbut dis wuz de worst I ever seed--dere wuz big red en white stripes all\nacross his face. He rared up an looked at me like a dog rare on his\nhaunches, and jes' dat way he wuz taller dan I wuz. I didden stop to\nlook again' but I lit out en run through dat cotton patch. Lawd ha'\nmercy! how I did run. I jes' knocked dat cotton one way er nother--en\ndey didden whip me for it when I tole em 'bout it nuther. Nex' mornin'\nwe went down der to look, en we seed de tracks where his knees had\nmade--thru de cotton patch, cross the road, en enter de woods. But no\nbody else never did see him. I often studied, wuz he natchel, or jes a\nghost.\n\n\n\"When my little brother wuz borned, I 'members dat day. Mammy and I wuz\nworking out in dis corn patch. She wuz coverin' corn, an she jes had\n'bout three or four more rows to cover, den she ran to de house. Dey wuz\njes one room en she tried to made de udder children go outside but dey\nwouldn' go, so she ran outside in de chimney corner, en soon dey heard a\nbaby holler. Dey called me to cum quick 'cause Mammy found a baby. By de\nspring house stood a ole tree--en I seed it had blown down an in de\nbranches was a big nest an de nest wuz empty. I sez--\"Rite dere's where\nmammy found her baby--rite outer dat nest\". Dey sez, \"No suh! She done\nfound it in de chimney corner, 'cause we heard it dere.\" No, mammy\ndidden need nobody to help tend to her. Aunt Hannah Erwin was a doctor\nwoman. She could sure cure a woman if she had child-bed fever--but my\nmammy didden need her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Frances Shaw Graves (Aunt Sally)\n\n\n\n\n    *Interview with Sarah Graves,*\n    *Skidmore, Missouri.*\n\n\n    _Still Carries Scars From Lashes_\n\n\n    \"Sweet are the uses of Adversity,\n    \"Which like a toad, ugly and venomous,\n    \"Wears yet a Jewel in its head.\"\n\n\n    --Shakespeare.\n\n\n\n\nChildhood and girlhood memories are vivid to Sarah Frances Shaw Graves,\nan 87 year old Negro woman whose indomitable courage and steadfast\npurpose overcame obstacles and made possible the ownership of the 120\nacre farm near Skidmore, on R.F.D. #4, where she lives with her bachelor\nson, Arza Alexander Graves.\n\n\nThe frame house which is their home, though small, is comfortable. It is\nsurrounded by a neatly kept yard, with flower beds and a cement walk\nwhich leads from the gate to the front door.\n\n\nThe visit had been arranged by telephone, and as the interviewer neared\nthe home, Aunt Sally could be seen standing, on the front porch, eagerly\nwatching and waiting. A \"close up\" showed that her immaculately washed,\nstiffly starched, print dress and apron were unwrinkled. Evidently she\nhad stood up ever since she had put them on.\n\n\nHer white hair was combed back off her fore-head, and held in place by\nside combs. Although age has lined her hands, and put deep furrows in\nher brown cheeks, her unquenchable will to overcome handicaps has held\nher body erect and shoulders undrooped. In spite of her years, most of\nwhich were spent in gruelling labor, she is rugged and healthy, and\nmeets the world with a smile and ready sympathetic laughter.\n\n\nShe was eager to begin her story, and led the way into the house, where\nat once the unmistakable signs of good housekeeping, cleanliness and\ntasteful arrangement are apparent. The home, though small, is moderately\nand comfortably furnished. They also enjoy the conveniences and\naccommodations of the rural telephone, a radio and a daily newspaper.\n\n\nHer life story is one of contrasts; contrasts of thought; contrasts of\nculture, beneficial inventions and suffrage. Not far from her home the\nglistening streamlined Zephyr speeds on twin rails beside the Missouri\nRiver, near the route of the slow-moving, creaking wagons on the ox-road\nof the 1850's.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _Sarah Frances Shaw Graves_]\n\n\nSkidmore, Nodaway Co., Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n\"My name is Sarah Frances Shaw Graves, or Aunt Sally as everybody calls\nme. Yes'm that's a lot of name an' I come by it like this. My husband\nwas owned by a man named Graves, and I was owned by a man named Shaw, so\nwhen we was freed we took the surnames of our masters.\n\n\n\"I was born March 23, 1850 in Kentucky, somewhere near Louisville. I am\ngoin' on 88 years right now. (1937). I was brought to Missouri when I\nwas six months old, along with my mama, who was a slave owned by a man\nnamed Shaw, who had allotted her to a man named Jimmie Graves, who came\nto Missouri to live with his daughter Emily Graves Crowdes. I always\nlived with Emily Crowdes.\"\n\n\nThe matter of allotment was confusing to the interviewer and Aunt Sally\nendeavored to explain.\n\n\n\"Yes'm. Allotted? Yes'm. I'm goin' to explain that,\" she replied. \"You\nsee there was slave traders in those days, jes' like you got horse and\nmule an' auto traders now. They bought and sold slaves and hired 'em\nout. Yes'm, rented 'em out. Allotted means somethin' like hired out. But\nthe slave never got no wages. That all went to the master. The man they\nwas allotted to paid the master.\"\n\n\n\"I never was sold. My mama was sold only once, but she was hired out\nmany times. Yes'm when a slave was allotted, somebody made a down\npayment and gave a mortgage for the rest. A chattel mortgage.\"\n\n\nA down payment!!\n\n\n\"Times don't change, just the merchandise.\n\n\n\"Allotments made a lot of grief for the slaves\", Aunt Sally asserted.\n\"We left my papa in Kentucky, 'cause he was allotted to another man. My\npapa never knew where my mama went, an' my mama never knew where papa\nwent.\" Aunt Sally paused a moment, then went on bitterly. \"They never\nwanted mama to know, 'cause they knowed she would never marry so long\nshe knew where he was. Our master wanted her to marry again and raise\nmore children to be slaves. They never wanted mama to know where papa\nwas, an' she never did\", sighed Aunt Sally.\n\n\nOnly those who have lost their mate, and never know the end of the tale,\ncan understand such heart anguish.\n\n\n\"Mama said she would never marry again to have children,\" continued Aunt\nSally, \"so she married my step-father, Trattle Barber, 'cause he was\nsick an' could never be a father. He was so sick he couldn't work, so me\nand mama had to work hard. We lived in a kitchen, a room in a log house\njoined on to the master's house. My mama worked in the field, even when\nI was a little baby. She would lay me down on a pallet near the fence\nwhile she plowed the corn or worked in the field.\n\n\n\"Stepfather and mama often tended their own tobacco and grain in the\nmoonlight. This they could sell and have the money. We could go to\nchurch which was held in the school house. Sometimes they let us play\nwith the other children after the noon dishes were washed and there\nwasn't anything else to do.\n\n\n\"There was most always something to do. Master never allowed nobody to\nbe idle. Mama worked in the house and the fields too. At night after she\ncome home from the field, she had to grate corn for the family next day.\nWe didn't have many grist mills them days, an' we would punch holes in a\npiece of tin, and rub the ear of corn across it and make meal for our\nuse.\n\n\n\"Nowadays, when you all want a nice wool dress, all you got to do is go\nto the store and get it\", Aunt Sally commented, when asked to tell about\ntheir clothing.\n\n\n\"When I was growin' up an' wanted a nice wool dress, we would shear the\nsheep, wash the wool, card it, spin it and weave it. If we wanted it\nstriped, we used two threads. We would color one by using herbs or\nbarks. Sometimes we had it carded at a mill, an' sometimes we carded it\nourselves. But when we did it, the threads were short, which caused us\nto have to tie the thread often, makin' too many knots in the dress. I\nhave gathered the wool off the fences where it had been caught off the\nsheep, an' washed it, an' used it to make mittens.\n\n\n\"Yes'm. I worked in the fields, and I worked hard too. Plantin' and\nharvestin' in those days was really work. They used oxen to break up the\nground for corn, an' for plowin' it too. They hoed the corn with a hoe,\nand cut the stalks with a hoe and shocked 'em. They cut the grain with\nthe cradle and bound it with their hands, and shocked it. They threshed\nthe grain with a hickory stick. Beating it out.\n\n\n\"I carried water for the field hands. I've carried three big buckets of\nwater from one field to another, from one place to another; one in each\nhand and one balanced on my head.\n\n\n\"Yes'm. Some masters was good an' some was bad. My mama's master whipped\nhis slaves for pastime. My master was not so bad as some was to their\nslaves. I've had many a whippin', some I deserved, an' some I got for\nbeing blamed for doin' things the master's children did. My master\nwhipped his slaves with a cat-o'-nine-tails. He'd say to me, 'You ain't\nhad a curryin' down for some time. Come here!!!' Then he whipped me with\nthe cat. The cat was made of nine strips of leather fastened onto the\nend of a whip. Lots of times when he hit me, the cat left nine stripes\nof blood on my back. Yes ma'am.\"\n\n\nAunt Sally brooded over the whipping memories, then under the influence\nof a brighter thought continued:--\n\n\n\"I belong to the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an' I ain't never\ncussed but once in my life, an' that was one time I nearly got two\nwhippin's for somethin' I didn't do. Some of master's kin folks had a\nweddin', an' we walked to the church, an' somebody kicked dust on the\nbride's clothes, an' I got blamed but I ain't never kicked it. The\nmaster's daughter Puss, she kicked it. Ole mistress she whipped me.\nYes'm, she whipped me. It was the worst whippin' I ever got. The worst\nwhippin' in my whole life, an' I still got the marks on my body. Yes'm.\nI got 'em yet.\n\n\n\"When the master come home, he was goin' to whip me again, an' I got\nmad, an' told him it was a lie, an' if Puss said I kicked dust on the\nwhite folks she was a DAMNED LYIN' DEVIL. He took the switch an' gave\nPuss a whippin' for tellin' a lie. Yes'm. That's the only time I ever\ncussed in my life.\n\n\n\"Yes'm, an' that's about all I knows about slavery and folks ways\nhereabouts. I can tell you about after we was freed. When we was freed\nall the money my mama had was 50 cents. I never went to school till\nafter I was freed. I went two winters and a little more to school near\nBurlington Junction. I never went a full term 'cause I had to work.\n\n\n\"I knowed my husband all my life. He was brought here by that man Jimmie\nGraves, that mama was allotted to. My husband took that name. His full\nname was Joseph H. Graves. We had one child, a boy. His name is Arza\nAlexander Graves. He lives here with me. It's our farm.\n\n\n\"I have lived on this place ever since I was married. That was in the\nsame year that Burlington Junction was started. We first bought 40 acres\nfor $10.00, then two years later we bought the back 80 acres for $15.00.\nThings is changed. We workin' for ourself now, an' what we get is our'n,\nan' no more whippin's. I worked in the fields and helped pay for this\nland. I belong to the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Maryville.\"\n\n\nThe day her family was freed, they had 50 cents. Today these children of\na transplanted race, once enslaved, have through years of steadfast\ncourage overcome the handicap of race and poverty. They threshed grain\nwith a hickory stick, and made their corn meal by grating the ears\nacross a strip of tin with holes punched in it.\n\n\nWith all her handicaps, this Negro woman has lived to an honorable old\nage, is self-supporting and has the respect of her neighbors. All this\nshe has accomplished despite the fact she was once a chattel and was\nfrequently \"curried down\" with a \"cat-o'-nine-tails.\"\n\n\n    *Interview with Sarah Frances Shaw Graves,*\n    *R.F.D. #4, Skidmore, Missouri.*\n\n\nSarah Frances Shaw Graves (Aunt Sally) whose address is R.F.D. #4\nSkidmore, Missouri is eighty-seven years of age. She lives with her\nbachelor son on their one-hundred-twenty acre farm. The home though\nsmall is moderately furnished and she enjoys the comforts of the rural\ntelephone and radio and daily newspapers in her home. The house is\nsurrounded by a nice yard containing many flowers and is enclosed with\nan iron fence, a cement walk leading from the front gate to the house.\n\n\nAunt Sally had been informed that the reporter was intending to call on\nher the following day and she was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the\nvisitor. The reporter was greatly impressed by the arrangement and\ncleanliness of Aunt Sally's modest home. Aunt Sally was immaculately\ndressed in a stiffly starched print dress and a fresh white apron. Her\nwhite hair was combed straight back off her forehead and held back with\nside combs. She was in a very excited talkative mood, and talked freely,\nand laughed heartily when the reporter explained the purpose of the\ninterview and asked the privilege of taking her picture. Actual\ninterview follows:\n\n\n\"My name is Sarah Frances Shaw Graves or Aunt Sally as everybody calls\nme. I am eighty-seven (87) years old and I was born March 23, 1850 in\nKentucky somewhere near Louisville. I was brought to Missouri when I was\nsix months old with my Mamma who was a slave owned by a man named Shaw\nwho had allotted her to a man named Jimmie Graves who came to Missouri\nto live with his daughter. Emily Graves Crowdes. I always lived with\nEmily Crowdes. We left my Papa in Kentucky as he belonged to another\nman. My Papa never knew where my Mamma and me went and my Mama and me\nnever knew where my Papa went. They never wanted Mama to know where my\nPapa was because they knew Mama would never marry as long as she knew\nwhere he was. Our Master wanted Mama to marry again and raise more\nchildren for slaves but Mama said she would never marry a man and have\nchildren so she married my step-father, Trattle Barber, because she knew\nhe had a disease and could not be a father. He was sick and not able to\nwork so me and Mama had to work hard. We lived in a kitchen, a room in a\nlog house joined on to the Masters house. All I knew about that part was\nwhat they told me. The Crowdes family who we came here with, settled\nnear Possum Walk which is near the place that is now called Burlington\nJct., Missouri. We were freed in 1863 but we heard so much about slavery\ncoming back that we stayed with the Crowdes' two years longer or until\n1865 when we was sure that we was freed. When we was freed we took the\nsame name as our Masters. We then lived about two miles north of them\nand worked for some of the neighbors who was poor and had children and\nwe lived on Lowell Livengood's grandfather's place for about two years.\nMamma had fifty (50c) cents coming to her and that is all the money we\nhad. My Mama did a washing for that money for a lady and the Mistress\ntold her that when the lady called for her washing that the fifty cents\nbelonged to us. This was after we was freed. I went to school near\nBurlington Jct., Missouri and my teacher's name was Rachel Libbey. I\nwent to school two winters a little while, I never went a full term any\ntime. I had to work and when the busiest time was over I would go to\nschool when I didn't work. I knew my husband all my life. He was owned\nby this man Jimmie Graves who Mama was alotted to, but was brought here\nby the man he was alloted to, named Nicholas. My husband's full name was\nJoe H. Graves. We had one child, a boy, whose name is Arza Alexander\nGraves. I have lived on this place I am on now every since I was\nmarried, that was the same year Burlington Jct., Missouri, started. We\nfirst bought forty (40) acres and paid twenty ($20.00) dollars for that,\nthen about two years later we bought the back eighty (80) acres and I\nthink we paid fifteen ($15.00) dollars for that. I worked in the fields\nand helped pay for this land. I belong to the African Methodist\nEpiscopal Church in Maryville, Missouri.\n\n\n\"When I was growing up and wanted a nice wool dress we would shear the\nsheep, wash the wool, card it, spin it, and weave it. If we wanted it\nstriped we used two threads, we would color one by using herbs and\nbarks. We sometimes had it carded at a mill and sometimes we carded it\nourselves but when we did it the threads were short which caused us to\nhave to tie the thread often making more knots in the dress. In planting\ncorn in them days they broke up the ground, one layed off the rows, one\nwould go along and drop the corn or grain and if they wanted to plant\nbeans in with the corn one would go along and drop the seed. They\ncovered it over with a hoe and they cut the stalks with the hoe and\nstacked up the stalks. The way they raised the corn after it came up\nthey took one horse and went on each side of a row and in the middle of\nevery row to plow the corn. It took three rounds on every row to get it\nplowed. They used oxen sometimes to plow and nearly always used oxen to\nplow up the ground. They cut the grain with the cradle and bound it with\ntheir hands and shocked it up. They thrashed the grain with a hickory\nstick by beating it out. Many times I have carried three big buckets of\nwater from one place to another, one in each hand and one balanced on my\nhead. My Master was not as bad as some Masters was to their slaves. One\ntime when I had over worked my Master said, \"You have not had a currying\ndown for a long time, come over here,\" and he whipped me with a\ncat-o'-nine-tails. This cat was made of nine small pieces of leather\nfastened on to the end of the whip. Lots of times when they hit with the\ncat it left nine stripes of blood. Mama's Master whipped his slaves for\npast-time. I have got many whippings for being blamed for doing things\nthe Master's children did and I was blamed for it. One time when a\ncouple was married, me and other members of the family were walking down\nthe road and I was very careful not to kick up any dirt and to be very\nnice to the couple but when we got home one of the Master's daughters\ntold that I was mean and that I kicked up dirt so that dust would get on\nthe lady's dress and I got the worst whipping I ever got in my life by\nthe Mistress and I still have the marks on my body, and when the Master\ncame I was carrying the vitales from the kitchen to the dining room\nwhich was the living and bed room and when I went in I took the bread\nand when I came back he was standing in the door and he told me what\nthey told him about me and I said I did not do it and if \"Puss\" said I\ndid she is a \"Damned lying devil\" and he dropped the switch and went and\ntalked to his daughter and gave her a whipping for telling the untruth.\nThat was the only time I ever swore. In a few days the bride came over\nvisiting and told them they had the sweetest little colored girl she was\nso lovely and kind. We were never allowed to be idle, always doing\nsomething and my work often was choring around to say I was doing\nsomething. I have gathered the wool off the fences where it had been\ncaught off the sheep and washed it and used it to make mittens. I never\nwas sold and my Mama was sold only once but she was hired out many\ntimes. We slept on what they called a bed, a tick filled with straw on\nthe bed. My Mama's Master had a child near my age and my Mama always\nleft me at the house with the Mistress and I nursed the Mistress, Mrs.\nCrowdes, as well as her own child until one day the curtain, which was\nused as a partition around a bed on which I lay near, caught on fire and\nthen my Mama always took me to the field with her and would lay me on a\npallet near the fence while she plowed the corn or worked in the field.\nStepfather and Mama often tended to their own tobacco and grain in the\nmoonlight which they could sell and have the money. One thing we could\ngo to church which was held in the school house. Sometimes they would\nlet me go out and play with the other children after the noon dishes\nwere washed and there wasn't anything else to do then. I often sewed\nstrips of cloth together to make carpet rags, there was always something\nto do. Mama worked in the field and in the house too. They nearly always\nkept a girl in the house. We did not have many mills and sometimes we\ncould not get to the mill and we would punch holes in a piece of tin and\nrub the ear of corn across it to grate it for our use. Many times Mama\nwould work in the field all day and in the evening she would grate\nenough corn for the family use the next day. The Masters had stores and\nyou had to go to that store and get your needs and when the month was up\nyou had nothing as it took all you earned to pay your bill.\"",

So I's just gonna\ntell you dis much, sister. Sure 'nough I was slave born.

I heard 'em say\ndey some times get fifty dollars for some of de black folks dey sold and\nsome big healthy ones brought one-hundred dollars. Course I don't know\nhow much money dey brought, I just know 'bout it. We use to go to de\nchurch house. If we suited de overseer he let us go. If we didn't we got\nlashed plenty.

        "text": "_\"Uncle\" Fil Hancock_\n\n\nThe following interview, bristling with facts and vivid recollections\ncovering more than three quarters of a century was obtained recently by\na worker employed by the Federal Writers' Project in Missouri from\n\"Uncle\" Fil Hancock, eighty-six year old Negro, living at Rolla,\nMissouri. The old man's story, told as nearly as possible in his own\ndialect runs thus:\n\n\n\"I was born 1851, de 28th day of February. My granny come here with her\nmissus-Hancock--when dey brung de Cherokee Indian tribe here from\nmiddlin' Tennessee, de time dey moved de Missouri Indians back to\nOklahoma, what dey called Indian Territory way back 'bout 135 or 140\nyears ago. Our old missus maiden name was Riggs. My old master was\nScotch-Irish. A big, red faced man wid sandy hair, mostly baldheaded. Us\nlittle niggers was scairt of him and run and hid when we see him coming.\nHe weren't 'lowed to whip us, 'cause he didn't own us. Our old missus\nhad eleven of us and he had twenty-one niggers of his own. And our old\nmissus wouldn't let him tech us.\n\n\n\"We had to mind him though. But she done de whipping. My own mammy\nwhipped us good and proper--She used a razor strop, and shore poured it\non us. She was puny and sick most all de time. Dey said she had\nconsumption, now-days dey calls it T.B. But it was plain old consumption\nin dem days. I 'member, she were so sick dat she were not able to hold\nus an' whip us, and she made one of us little niggers push de other one\nup to her bed while she whipped us. We took our turns in gittin' a\nwhipping. Poor old mammy, she loved us and wanted us to do right. We\nnever got a whipping 'ceptin' we needed it. Old granny, my mammy's\nmother and old missus whipped us a little, an only wid buckbresh, jes' a\nlittle 'roun' de ankles. All us little niggers was jes' like stairsteps,\none after de other. I got whipped plenty, but I needed it.\n\n\n\"My ol' missus Hancock named me herself--called me Filmore Taylor\nHancock, after two presidents who took der seats in 1850. Ol' Colonel\nHancock was our master an' he was de richest man in Greene County,\nMissouri, and owned more slaves than any man in Missouri. His wife, old\nmissus was born in 1804. My own granny on my mammy's side was born in\n1805. My granny was given to missus, as her own de day she was born.\n'Course old missus was only a year old den. Der was thirty-two of us\nslaves on our old missus place, and eleven of us sprung from old granny.\n\n\n\"We had five young missus. My young missus names were Winnie, Elizabeth,\nLucinda, Luella, and Tennessee. Dey was so rich and proud, dey wouldn't\nlook at any body to marry. Only two of 'em ever married. Dey was fine\nladies, but dey shore had me plumb spilt. Some of dem whipped me three\nor four times, but I 'member how dey jes' breshed me a little roun' de\nlegs, and turn away and laugh a little. I can see now I needed more'n I\ngot. If I told a lie I got whipped for it, and old missus poured it on\nif we lied.\n\n\n\"I and de other two gals, my sisters and a brudder of mine--well, when\nour mammy died, old missus took us down to her house, away from our\ncabin, so she could look after us. Our old granny was de white folk's\ncook. She helped look after us. We got to eat what de white folk did. Up\nto de cabins where de other niggers was, had salt meat, cabbage,\n'taters, and shortnin' bread three times a day. We all had plenty\nvegetables we raised ourselves. Every Sunday mornin' our missus sent us\nup a big tray 'bout three feet long, made of sycamore--and it full of\nflour. Once a week we had hot biscuits. But me and Squire, my brudder\nand my sisses, Mary and Margot had it a little better, we had what our\nold missus had. I was ten years an' six months old when de war come up.\n\n\n\"In '61, I see General Lyons, when he passed right by our house. All de\nUnion sojers had to pass by our house time of de war. We lived on the\nmain wagon road from Rolla to Springfield. Well child, Lordy me! dat's\nfunny for me to tell you how General Lyon look. It was a sight to see\nhim with them 'purties'! And we asked old missus what dat was, them\n'purties' he had on his shoulders. She says to us chillun: 'He is de\ngeneral. All dem odder men got to mind him'. He was killed in dat battle\nof Wilson Creek. Dey kept him in an icehouse in a spring, owned by a man\nnamed Phelps. He lived west of Springfield. Dey keep General Lyon two\nweeks, 'fore they brung him down dis-a-way. Dey shipped him out of Rolla\nto Connecticut--dat's what I hear de ol folks says. Dat man Phelps was\nour neighbor and later he got to be governor of Missouri in 1876.\nCrittenden was first de Democratic governor in '73.\n\n\n\"Old missus called us little darkies all up--and carried us down to de\nwagon General Lyon's body was in, when dey was bringin' him back here.\nAnd we looked at him and asked what was de matter. Old missus said 'He\nwas killed.' He was packed in ice in de wagon and de wagon had four\nmules hitched to it. I wanted to know if he was de man who had dem\n'purties' on his shoulders. She said 'Yes'.\n\n\n\"I said, 'Did marse Bill and marse George and marse Jeff Hancock hep\nkill him?' She said: 'Yes'. Marse Bill, marse George an' marse Jeff was\nmy young bosses, my old master's sons. Old missus didn't seem glad or\nanything, jes' looked kinda sad. We asked her would he ever fight again.\nShe said, 'No'. I won't ever forget how General Lyon looked. He rode a\nkinda gray-white horse when I first see him and looked so tall and proud\nlike.\n\n\n\"De rebels held Springfield from 1861 till 1862, when General Freemont\ncome in and took it. Marmaduke and Price had de biggest armies of de\nsoutherners, Freemont come sneaking in, wrapped his wagon wheels with\nold blankets so dey wouldn't hear him coming, and he had a body guard of\nthree hundred. Marmaduke and Price was den in Springfield. Freemont come\n'bout daybreak, and started shooting de town up. He got de town and held\nit.\n\n\n\"Marmaduke and Price drifted 'round to de Southeast part of de State and\nwent into Arkansas. Later dey had a three hour scrummage at Pea Ridge,\nArkansas. Either 62 or 63, I kaint 'member much, I was too little and\nscairt to know. Being only ten or eleven years old. Dey was a man named\nFinis McCrae, a rebel in de Marmaduke and Price Army, in de infantry. He\ntook sick some place in Arkansas. Dey brung him to us, we being rebels,\nand keep him two weeks in our up-stairs, not letting any one know he was\ndere. We kept him till he got better and he went back into de army and\nfit some more.\n\n\n\"I seen Marmaduke in person, when he was making his campaign for\ngovernor, down in Cuba, Missouri. All de Union sojers stopped at our\nhouse to get water. We had a runnin' stream that never did go dry. They\nfilled their canteens there. All us chillun fussed 'bout 'em takin' our\nmilk and butter outen de spring-house. Old missus keep all her milk and\nbutter and cheese in dere to keep it cool. When de Union sojers come by\nour house to Rolla dey took so much of de water to fill dere canteens it\nnearly took our spring dry. Took every thing we had in de\nspring-house--milk, butter--everything.\n\n\n\"I don't 'member how dey was dressed, but dey all had on sumpin' blue.\nUniforms I guess. Me and four more little darkies was one-half mile\noffen de big road when dey passed, and got scared and run back to old\nmissus house and hid in de old barn loft all dat night. Old missus asked\nus what we did for sumpin' to eat. We told her we bent de rye down in de\nfield and rubbed de grain out wid our hands and eat dat. She took us to\nde house and give us sompin' to eat. De sojers was still passing de\nhouse den.\n\n\n\"In time of de Civil War we wouldn't come down to Rolla, we went south\nto do our trading. We wasn't Union and Rolla was Union Headquarters. Old\nMaster was getting old den, he had been a colonel in some army or other\nway 'fore de Civil War.\n\n\n\"Lincoln issued 'green backs' 'long 'bout '61 or '62, after Stephen A.\nDouglas goes up to Washington and tell Lincoln, after he got de\n'nomination dat if he didn't get Jeff Davis and some of de leaders and\nprosecute 'em, he was going to have war on his hands. Lincoln tells\nDouglas to go back and tell Jeff Davis to lay dem guns down, dat in 90\ndays he would 'low dem so much a head for dere niggers. Dat if dey would\nfree dem dey could be paid for so much a head, by taxation. But Lincoln\ntold dem dey would all have to come back together again same as before\nlike dey was. You see dese folks in de south had done got $8,000,000,\nall dat ammunition and guns and things from England. Jeff Davis and dem\nleaders wouldn't give it up.\n\n\n\"De first issue of greenbacks was $175,000,000 and de next issue was\n$250,000,000. We had been told all dis and I ask old missus if she\nreckon we could whip dem 'blue bellied yankees'. I says: 'Dey ain't got\nno money'.\n\n\n\"We called de Union sojers--'Yankees' and our side was called de Gray or\nde Rebels. It's 75 years, the 10th day of August, 1937, that General\nLyon was killed.\n\n\n\"My boss--Hancock was de biggest slave holder in Missouri when de war\nfirst come up. He settled four miles east of Springfield, Missouri. He\nowned close to 1200 or 1500 acres of ground. From Springfield to\nStrafford--east. We had 375 acres in cultivation--corn, oats, wheat,\nrye, and clover was our main crops.\n\n\n\"My daddy belonged to a man named Lou Langston. There is a railroad\nstation named for this same Langston. What was known as the 'Gulf Road.'\nI took my mammy's white folk's name. They were as fine and good as\nanybody. The first child old missus had was a boy, Bill Hancock. The\nfirst child my old granny had (on my mammy's side) was a boy, named Joe.\nOld missus gave granny's boy Joe, to her boy Bill, as a slave. You see\nmy old missus and my old granny was born a year apart demselves.\n\n\n\"One time my old master Hancock, got mad at my uncle, who was a growed\nup nigger. Old marse wanted to whip him. He tried to make my uncle put\nhis head twixt his (old marser's) knees. My uncle didn't offer to fight\nhim, but twisted him roun' and roun' trying to get his head out. He gave\none twist dat throwed old marse down to de ground. My uncle jumped and\nrun and jumped over de fence. My uncle did not belong to old marse but\nto his son, Bill. But old marse sure got mad when my uncle run. So he\nsold him to a man named Dokes--a nigger trader of dat neighborhood.\nDokes bought niggers and sold dem on de block in St. Louis. When Dokes\ntook my uncle away, one of our neighbors by de name of Fisher--up near\nStrafford, gits on his horse and goes to Springfield and tells my young\nboss, Bill, dat old man Hancock had sold Joe and Jane. Jane belonged to\nMarse Hancock. Mister Fisher had only one colored man, and he told my\nyoung boss, Bill, dat if he would buy both them niggers back, dat he\nwould buy Jane for his (Fisher's) colored man. He didn't have no woman\nfor him.\n\n\n\"Old Dokes was on his way den to St. Louis with 'em. Bill and Fisher\nstarted out, rode and caught up with dem near what is now known as Knob\nView, Missouri. When dey come in sight of Dokes, Bill stopped and\ndropped back. Fisher goes up to de wagon, stopped Dokes and asked him\nwhat he would take for Joe and Jane. They was settin' up in the wagon\nhandcuffed together. I think it was a thousand dollars or fifteen\nhundred dollars he asked for both. Den Fisher beckoned to Bill Hancock\nto come on. Bill come up and paid Dokes what he asked. Dokes was to take\n'em back, hisself, to dere own neighborhood.\n\n\n\"When marse Bill rode up, my uncle said, 'Take these handcuffs off me'.\nMr. Dokes took them off. My uncle jumped out of de wagon and run up to\nde big mule my young boss was settin' on, he reached up an' took Bill,\nhis marster off dat mule so quick and lay him down on de ground. He\ncommenced to love and kiss him on side of his head. He picked him up and\nsat marse Bill on his mule again and said, 'I know marse Bill wasn't\ngoin' to let me be sold.' He takes him off his mule again and lay him\ndown two times more and keep lovin' and kissin' him, he was dat happy.\n\n\n\"But old marse Hancock, jes' wouldn't let Joe live on his place again,\nno more. He was dat mad. It made him so mad to think Joe had turn him\nover when he had his legs twixt his knees. But young marse Bill took Joe\nto Springfield and hired him out to a blacksmith by de name of Lehr. He\ngot forty dollars a month for him. Joe stayed dere till de Civil War.\nOld master let Joe come to de house to see his mother, my old granny,\nonce in a while, but never to live.\n\n\n\"Old man Fisher bought de colored woman from marse Bill, for his colored\nman, and paid him as he could. Our white folks had plenty of money to\nget any thing they wanted.\n\n\n\"I first come to Rolla in 1869 and stayed till 1870. Then dere was only\none brick house in Rolla, standin' where the Edwin Long Hotel now\nstands. Den I left and went to Cuba and stayed dere and at Salem til'\n1882. I come back to Rolla when de Crandel House was built, where de\nRolla Hospital now is located. I started a barber shop here under the\nCrandel House basement. I have been here and at Salem ever since 1882,\nRolla my headquarters.\n\n\n\"If I can leave enough when I die, I want to be buried at the Union\nGraveyard in Greene County, Missouri, where my mammy is buried since\nthree years before the Civil War. My daddy was buried there in 1863.\n\n\n\"When I was young, we didn't know nuthin' 'bout churches. Us kids never\ngot to go no place 'less de old niggers took us. And dey wouldn't take\nus. De older ones had church out in de brash, under de shade trees.\n\n\n\"I kin 'member one of my cousins carryin' me pick-a-back, one time,\nthree miles to church. Dey only had church in de summer time, or meeting\ndey called it. It was allus in de woods. We dassen't be ketched wid a\nbook to read or to try to be educated. Course every one wasn't treated\ndat-a-way. Sometimes de niggers would have dancin', if de bosses or\nmasters gave dem passes. De passes read sumpin' like dis: 'Let my nigger\nfile pass and repass to such and such a place'.\n\n\n\"I 'member once, my missus bought me a pair of high top red boots. My! I\nwas proud. In dem days, we went barefoot most all year round. But my\nmissus tried to make us happy on Christmas. I put dem boots on and I\npranced round and round jes' to hear dem squeak. I done thought dat was\nde purtiest noise I ever heard. I asked old missus, could I go to old\nMassy's house. He were our neighbor, 'bout half mile--but it were dark.\nOld missus said, 'Hain't you scared to go?' I say, 'No'. I went up de\nroad, my boots squeaking and squeaking. Didn't have time to be\nscared--listenin' to dem boots.\n\n\n\"Aunt Rachel, my own aunt, lived at Massy's house. You see Masseys was\ndere name and dey was white folks but we say Massy's house. I wanted my\nold aunt to see my new boots. When I got dere I called my aunt to come\nsee my boots. She come and say, 'Hain't you scared to come here all\n'lone'. I say, 'no'. I twisted and turn, round and round so she could\nhear 'em squeak. But when it come time to go home, I got plum' scared.\nAunt Rachel had to take me. She took me where I could see our house. My!\nHow old missus laughed when she found I had to be brung home. She say,\n'I told you, you be scared to come alone'.\n\n\n\"In dem days no nigger got boots till he was big and able to work for\n'em. I was old missus pet and she plum' spilt me. I allus got more'n de\nodder niggers got. Boys had cotton shirts and de gals had cotton\ndresses.\n\n\n\"You know it's a funny thing, de white folks took everything from us\nniggers, even try to take our old songs and have dem on de radio. We\nniggers say 'De white folks take everything, dis, dat, an' t'other, but\nwhat we got is jes' natural borned to us.'\n\n\n\"I knocks a tamborine jes' like de Georgia niggers played a tambourine,\n'fore de Civil War. Dem Georgia minstrels was taken over to England to\nperform 'fore de Queen Victoria, way 'fore Civil War. Folks from way up\nEast got 'em and took 'em. Dey ain't many plays like dem no more.\"\n\n\n\"Uncle\" Fil, as he was familiarly known in Rolla, played for the Folk\nFestival in Rolla and received so much applause, he had to be helped off\nthe stage. He is exceedingly active. He plays the old tambourine, (he\nowned so many years) under and over his legs, behind his head, bouncing\nit and catching it, never losing the rhythm an instant.\n\n\nHe is tall and erect, and has a remarkable memory, especially for dates,\nnames and places. He loves children, and usually has a pocket full of\npennies for the babies. His home is a one-room hut (plain shed building)\nback of the Post Office on Ninth Street, Rolla, Missouri. He lives alone\nand has no living relatives. The people of Rolla aid him with gifts.\n\n\nUncle \"Fil's\" favorite old spiritual is below. He says: \"Dis song, I'm a\ntellin' you, is de truf.\"\n\n\n    Dis Is My Buryin' Groun'\n\n\n    Ask my Lord for mercy,\n    Good Lord, gimme religion,\n    Good Lord, gimme me a heart to b'lieve,\n    Dis is de buryin' groun'.\n    Amen, Hallelujah. Dis is de buryin' groun'.\n\n\n    Tell your mother,\n    Tell your father,\n    Dis is de buryin' groun',\n    Tell all your neighbors,\n    Tell all your neighbors chillun,\n    Dis is de buryin' groun'.\n\n\nUncle Fil says, \"Niggers jes' makes dey own verses, jes' naturally comes\nto us, and we make our own rhyme as we go.\"\n\n\nOne of the humorous songs, a favorite of his, goes:\n\n\n    You, by word, now all we go,\n    In fact we spoke both high and low,\n    In the house and out of doors,\n    Ebening in the baby's nose.\n    When I was young an' in my prime,\n    I'se a countin' courtin' them gals,\n    Most all de time.\n    Now I'm old and you will see,\n    I'm not as young as I used to be.\n    Now when the elephant moves aroun'\n    The music begins to play,\n    Oh, the boys aroun' dat monkey's cage\n    I'd better keep away.\n    Rock the cradle John,\n    Rock the cradle John,\n    Many a man is rockin' another man's son\n    When he thinks he's rockin' his own.",

He was\nnot at all reticent about telling of his life though plainly curious to\nknow the purpose of the interview and just a bit skeptical as to its\nfinal use. Dave, who now lives in Montgomery City, Mo., has been a\ngardener for years, always having the earliest and finest vegetables as\nwell as supplying others with plants for resetting.\n\n\n\"I'll be glad to tell you anything I remember,\" Dave said in reply to\nthe request for something of his life story. \"Col. Harper was my master.\nWe lived northwest of town (Montgomery City). I was born in Montgomery\nCounty and lived dere all my life. Col. Harper had 25 or 30 slaves; dere\nwas lots of money wrapped up in dem.\"\n\n\nHere Dave reflected for a moment and shook his head sadly at the amount\nof cash invested in humans and then continued.\n\n\n\"He bought me when I was six years old. I was born eighty-seven years\nago next January, down on Clear Fork, southwest of Danville, near\nMineola, 'bout half mile from Capt. Callaway's grave. No'm, it don't\nseem like dey could have found enough dirt dere to cover his body. It\nsure is rocky dere. Did you ever read Nat Sharp's history? It says dat\none of Capt. Callaway's men was buried down dere across de field.\n\n\n\"I've seen slaves go through Danville in droves like cattle. Dey was\nchained together and dey walked 'em to St. Louis to de nigger yard. One\nmother give out. De man in charge made her give her baby away, she\ncouldn't carry it no further. Someone near Danville raised de baby.\n\n\n\"I was sold when I was six years old to Clark Whitesides's father to\nnurse Clark. My mother was sold down on de Missouri River. I'll tell you\n'bout dat. De Fords moved to Danville from Virginia. Dere was several\nbrothers in together in de nigger business. Dey brought my mother to\nwait on Mrs. Ford and carry her her coffee. She married and had three\nchildren. De nigger traders from Virginia run an attachment to get\npossession of my mother. Den on de way back he took cholera and died. De\ncase was in court when de war come up. Mr. Ben Sharp had de money, he\ndied and dat ended it. I was sold by Thos. J. Powell, de sheriff. Mother\nwas to be sold. Kit Talbot bid on her and de baby. She cried so hard\n'cause she wanted to live with me dat Dr. Sharp paid de bid and got her.\nI used to go to see her real often.\n\n\n\"We was fed just moderate. Dere was fifteen hands. When dey come in at\nnoon, dey ate from de big old kettle where de old colored woman had\ncooked de food. De next morning after he bought me, de boss carried me\nto de old woman and told her to take care of me. Dat morning de kettle\nwas full of spare ribs and de people fished dem out with sticks. I\ndidn't see no knives or forks. When dey asked me why I didn't get\nsomething to eat, I asked 'bout dem and a table where I could eat. De\noverseer just cried.\n\n\n\"De old lady took care of de children while de mothers worked. De oldest\none never went to de field. She just looked after de little ones. One\noverseer was colored. He was an uncle of 'Big Nig' dat works at de\nhotel. We was fanning out wheat and one of de children was raking out de\nwheat. He talked back to de overseer who struck him. Dere was a\nsingletree under de edge of de cloth. De master picked up de singletree\nbut didn't strike de overseer, he backed off. Col. Harper raised oodles\nof tobacco. Dere were 16 to 17 hundred pounds to de hogshead. He raised\n15 to 20 hogsheads.\n\n\n\"My mother-in-law was from Memphis. One day dey went to church and de Ku\nKlux Klan came in and beat de people over deir heads with pistols. De\npeople went out de doors and windows. Dey could just blow a horn and de\nKu Klux Klan would come from all directions.\n\n\n\"I was sold for $715. When de freedom come, I said, 'Give me $715 and\nI'll go back.' Col. Harper just gave me a quarter to buy my dinner.\nAfter de freedom, I worked in wheat harvest all season for $.75 a day. I\nworked for a week and my mammy told me to bring her some bacon. When de\nman paid me, I spent it all for a side of bacon. I felt mighty proud to\ntake dat to her. Bacon was $.50 a pound. I stayed at Dr. Sharp's where\nmother worked and done chores. Later I made rails. Dey paid me $14 a\nmonth for cutting rail timber. I was paid at de postoffice and took de\nmoney home and gave it to mammy.\n\n\n\"Col. Harper's wife was Gen. Price's niece and Col. Harper was a\nrecruiting officer for Gen. Price. Young men came dere to join de\nsouthern army. Dey could always get a horse. De women stayed dere all de\ntime to make de suits for de soldiers. De Union soldiers tried deir best\nto kill Col. Harper.\n\n\n\"One time I saved his life. Dey was going to kill him, 'bout 75 or 100\nmen on horses. I warned de Colonel two hours before dey got dere. Dis is\nhow it happened. Col. Harper gave me de first day of Christmas to go to\nsee my mother. Us children went out in de woods playing and when we come\nback de yard was all cut up with horses hoofs. Dr. Sharp put me on my\nhorse and told me to tell Col. Harper dis message, dat 'dere was so many\nsoldiers dat you might get hurt, you can come again some other time.' I\ntold Col. Harper and he left. I didn't see him again until I was cutting\nwheat.\n\n\n\"My mistress lived dere for some time without any menfolks 'round 'cept\nde slaves. Dere was a horse kept dere on purpose so I could come to town\nevery day for de mail. After a while, my mistress and her daughter went\nto Jarod Harris's to stay. Den I went to Harris's every morning for de\nmistress orders and to Montgomery each afternoon for de mail. I took de\nmail to de camp at night. Dat was Bill Anderson's camp over in Callaway\nCounty. Dey moved dat camp pretty often but I found it. One time de\nbushwhackers came to burn de depot but Col. Harper had it full of\ntobacco and wheat so dey didn't burn it.\n\n\n\"Young Billy Mathis was a lieutenant. He used to come to see mistress\nalmost every day and bring her messages. Once a gang of blue coats was\ncoming down de road. He got on one of mistress' horses and she told me\nto go 'long and bring de horse back. We went down through de woods with\nde bullets whistling through de air and cutting off de limbs of de\ntrees.\"\n\n\nDave had apparently studied about the voodoo doctors and their wiles for\na question as to conjure doctors brought a quick response:\n\n\n\"We call dem 'two headed Negroes'. You know dat if he could do any\ntricks he would keep dem from whipping him or selling him and dey\ncouldn't do dat or dey would have done it long time ago. Tear open a\npillow and sometimes dere is a mat of feathers. Sometimes dey puts\nthings under de door step but I don't pay no 'tention to it. Dey is some\ndat thinks dere is something to it.\n\n\n\"Mother used to tell a tale 'bout when she was a little girl. Her mother\nwent to frolics but her father went to bed, he was always tired after\nhis day's work. One night my mother saw a woman come to her father's bed\nand rub her hand over his head. It didn't wake him up. De next day he\ntook sick and soon died. I don't believe in hoodoo doctors but it is\nlike de blood hounds can run and tree a man but if you can't find de\ngoods it don't count.\n\n\n\"I worked in de hay harvest for $.50 a day. Common domestic for shirts\nwas $.50 a yard. It took six yards to make one shirt, dat was a week's\nwork. We lived on chickens. My mother raised a whole camp meeting of\nchickens. Dere never was a better white man dan Dr. Sharp. When I\nmarried I had four head of horses and three mules. I owed for one team\nof horses. I took typhoid fever in August and was in bed until November.\nDr. Sharp and Dr. Bodine knew something was de matter but dey didn't\nknow what it was. When de note come due, I got on a horse and rode to\nDr. Sharp's. He wanted to know what I was doing on dat horse. I told him\n'bout de note and he said, 'Hum, dat's what's been bothering you. Don't\nyou get off dat horse! I help you den you get back home and go to bed\nand stay dere!' He just wrote a check for $90, I had already paid $300.\nAfter I got well, I sold a span of mules to Joe McCleary and put de\ncheck in de bank for Dr. Sharp. Dat was to pay him for de note and\ntaking care of me dat summer and fall.\n\n\n\"I was in de railroad home guards during de war. We had to keep de\npeople from tearing up de railroads. I fought Bill Anderson's men many a\ntime. Seems sort of queer when I used to take dem de mail but we kept\ndem from burning de railroad bridges.

        "text": "_How Did Uncle Joe Get Home?_\n\n\nLiving at 410 West Pettis Street, Sedalia, is Joseph Higgerson, a\npensioned Negro soldier of the Civil War, who can look back through the\nlong vista of years and visualize slave life in Missouri, when the\ninstitution of slavery was at its most thriving period.\n\n\nHe was born a slave on a farm near Boonville, Missouri, in 1845 if his\nclaim of being 92 years old in the summer of 1937, is correct.\n\n\nHe is somewhat bent and withered and his appearance of great age is\naccentuated by white patriarchal whiskers below the chin, while his\ncheeks are clean shaven; a style much in vogue during the life time of\nHorace Greeley.\n\n\nHis home, a little, four room, frame cottage, with its tiny front porch\nset close against the picket fence enclosing the lot, mirrors somewhat\nthe deterioration age has placed upon its occupant. Both house and fence\nare weather beaten, gray from age and lack of paint.\n\n\n\"Could you and would you tell about slavery days?\" he was asked.\n\n\n\"Yes Ma'am,\" he courteously and smiling replied, the smile revealing\nbig, strong teeth. \"Yes, indeed. Would you all step in the house and\nset? I am so happy to have company.\"\n\n\nHe selected the dining room, which is also the comfortably furnished\nliving room, as the place to \"set and talk\". In this room is an oak\ndining table, chairs and a china closet, through the glass doors of\nwhich may be seen attractively decorated dishes, some of them of very\nold pattern. There is also an old fashioned combination desk and book\ncase, and a chest of drawers. The windows are adorned with curtains and\ndrapes of good quality.\n\n\nThe clean condition of the interior was a revelation of a 92 year old\nNegro man's desire and ability to keep house, and keep it clean. He\nlives alone, his wife having died many years ago.\n\n\nThere is in the appearance of this ancient Negro with shoulders now\nbowed; the dark brown skin, extending across the bald head; the large\nnose; immense teeth; shaven cheeks below which a mat of white whiskers\nencircle the throat, like the ruff on a condor's neck; there is in his\nappearance that which stamps him at once as the living bridge between\nthe present day's civilization and a dim past; the knowledge of which\nexists today in the memories of but few persons.\n\n\nAs he talked, strange sights, scenes and cultures were told, sometimes\nwith words that have changed much in meaning.\n\n\nAs his mind pictured the scenes of those old days, this primitive\nblending of both Indian and Negro races, at times unconsciously reverted\nto the primitive sing song recitative chant of his ancestors,\nparticularly when narrating his outstanding pleasant memories.\n\n\nThis is his story:\n\n\n\"Old man Higgerson was my mastar. We lived on a farm and dere was a big\nfamily of us. I is the only one left. The farm laid just below the\nLamine and Missouri Rivers, and I can't tell exactly where it was.\nEverybody called us 'free niggahs'--cause Higgerson slaves was treated\nso good. Yes, ma'am. My mammy lived to be 80 years old--and didn't have\na gray hair in her haid. She was part Black Hawk Indian,--and I show it\nin me too.\"\n\n\nThen as his thoughts raced back to slavery days, the pictures of youth\ncrowded thick and fast, and he burst forth into a half chanted\ndescription of the panorama of his memories. \"I've seen hundreds of\nIndians pass thru the country, on foot. Boss man let' em have a shack\novernight. Next mawnin dey set out on foot, and take up de road, one\nbehind the othar. Yes, suh! Just wrapped in a blanket one behind the\nothar. Winter and summer, and barefoot too!\"\n\n\nThen he told of game and game ways.\n\n\n\"Yes suh! I done seen wild deer hop ovar fences, and hundreds of wild\nturkeys. We used to build turkey pens and dig a trench, put feed in dere\nand covar it ovar wid bresh and de turkeys would come to feed, and we\nwould trap' em. Yes, ma'am, an I done seen 100 to 150 wild turkeys in a\nflock. I has dat! Lots of wild pigeons, too. I has seen a thousand geese\nflyin' over in the early mornin'. Then I've trapped quail too, in rail\npens, built ten feet square. Yes, suh!\n\n\n\"But listen!--slaves couldn't shoot; was a law agin it in slaves times;\nno slave could own or shoot a gun. We couldn't shoot game. An' dat come\ndis way. President Jackson say, 'Keep books and guns outa slaves' hands\nif you want to keep 'em slaves'.\"\n\n\nJoe Higgerson chuckled a little with a glint of humor in his eyes and\nchanged the subject.\n\n\n\"Everybody made whiskey in dem days, had little 'stilleries all over the\ncountry, made apple and peach brandy. Good too. One day I was sent to a\nneighbor's for brandy. I took a little taste and walked on. Den I took\nanoder little taste, and walked on. Den I took anoder little taste and\nsot down de jug. Den I took anoder little taste, and so on and so on.\nPretty soon I looked up, and I nevar did know how I got to whar I'se\ngwin ter. Nobody ever say anything about it or tell me nuffin! I guess\nsomebody carry me whar I'se gwin ter.\"\n\n\nHe was asked if he ever remembered seeing slaves sold at Boonville.\n\n\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" he exclaimed. \"Why down at Boonville, woman and a baby was\nput up to be sold, and de buyer he want de woman, but he don't want de\nbaby, so they separated 'em, and was gettin' ready to put 'em on de boat\nfor Noo Orleans, and ship 'em down de river, and de woman she ran back\nto kiss de baby goodbye, and de tradar picked up a whip and cracked it\nand shouts, 'A bellerin' cow will soon forget its calf'. She was sold\ndown de river and nevar saw de baby again. Now dat was sad.\" He paused\nand then resumed.\n\n\n\"One tradar, name of Henry Moore, he used to handcuff all the niggahs\ntogether till time to put 'em on de boat for Noo Orleans. Dey always\ncarried whips and they'd crack dem to see how far de darkies could jump.\nYes, Suh!! Yes, Suh!!! Deed they did!!!\"\n\n\nThis reminiscence tickled him mightily and he laughed heartily at\nthoughts of the capers the negroes cut when the whip cracked.\n\n\n\"An I remembers one boat load. Boat load got as far as Cairo, Illinois,\nand lots of de darkies jumped overboard and was drowned.\"\n\n\n\"Were the overseers on the plantations Negroes or whites?\"\n\n\n\"Overseahs, white,\" Higgerson replied, \"Overseahs white. A darky was the\nniggah driver. Darkies didn't ever get to go to the big house where the\nplanter lived. De niggah driver reported to the overseah, and the\noverseah reported to the boss.\n\n\n\"Now this is the way with me,\" Higgerson continued. \"My father, who was\nalso my boss, he kept a store, and I went to de store to take care of de\nchildren, cause de boss done send for me. Well, one time when the wah\nwas on, some Federal soldiers come and done scared me so bad I forgot\nall about de chile and run home, and de soldiers burned de bridge, you\nhad to cross befo' you got to de store. So after dat de ole man run a\nboat across.\"\n\n\nHoping to get some idea of how Christmas was celebrated among the\nNegroes on the farms and plantations the aged man was asked what he\nremembered of Christmas, in slavery times.\n\n\n\"One Christmas I never goin' to forget\", he replied.\n\n\n\"Jes before Christmas lots of people came to de store to buy and de\ngroun' was all covered wid snow. An de man what run de store was getting\nready to close up, cause it was getting dark, and close at dark a man\ncome and wanted in and de store keeper wouldn't let him in. An it got\nlater and later, and by an by Joseph, dats me, was sent to de store to\nfind why de storekeeper ain't come home yet and Joseph went to de store,\nand looked in and saw de old man on his back, his throat cut wid de\nblood runnin' all over de floor and $1,400 dey knowed he had--gone. Dere\nwas whiskey and blood runnin' all over de floor. Whiskey was cheap dem\ndays; good whiskey, too.\n\n\n\"When they set the niggahs free, the boss man come out and read de\npapers to 'em sayin' dey was free. And I went to Boonville and joined de\nUnion Army, November 23, 1863. I served in de 25th Corps, Second\nDivision under General Whitsell. I was in de last battle of de war at\nPalmetto Ranch, Texas, on de Rio Grande, just 36 miles from de Gulf.\nWhen I was discharged from de army to go home, I thought--why I have no\nhome, where shall I go? Den I decided to go back to Boonville. All my\nfamily was scattered.\n\n\n\"But I was lucky. Someone had started to build a shack, and had not\nfinished it. I got permission to finish it and picked up building\nmaterial here and dere, and made it into a home. I never been without a\nhome since. My wife and I lived together 61 years. She is gone now.\"",

        "text": "_Smoked 'Em Upside Down_\n\n\nThe subject of this sketch is Delia Hill, over 90 years old. She lives\nat 1338 Argus Street, St. Louis County, Missouri.\n\n\nDelia Hill is a good natured, well preserved old lady. She is quite\ntall, medium in size, dark complexion and her hair is almost entirely\nwhite. She is very neat in her quaint, frame three room cottage. She\nshares her home with a widowed companion who appears to be well in her\n50's but is able to work. Delia Hill's story follows:\n\n\n\"I was born in Cold Water, Mississippi more dan 90 years ago but don't\nknow jes' how old I is. My first owner's name was Marse John Hawkins and\nhe had a big mill. He had me and my mother with 14 other chillen, Aunt\nEllen and her 8 chillen, and Aunt Tilda with all her chillen. I don't\nknow how many Aunt Tilda had. Anyhow Marse John owned every one of us.\nLater on he sold me to Marse Dave Stafford, a circuit rider. I got a\nscar on my eye today whar de ole overseer throwed a fork at me cross de\ntable, 'cause I went to sleep, I was so tired while fanning flies off\nhim while he's eatin'. I had to fan flies every meal time with a fly\nbrush. They worked me so hard, I'd just go on to sleep standin' up. Dat\nold overseer was a mean old devil any how. Well when old Marse come home\nfrom de circuit ridin' I told him 'bout it, and he fired dat overseer\nright then and told him if my eye went out, he would look him up and\nkill him. I never seed him anymore.\n\n\n\"Dey sold us niggahs so bad down dere where I come from, dat when I was\nlittle I got sold from my mother and she never found me till after de\nwar in 1871. Was we glad to see each other? I say we was. I was raised\nup hard, honey. I can count de winters I ever even had shoes on my poor\nfeet. When Marse Dave bought my mother he only bought her and 6 us\nchillun. He was fairly nice to niggahs, but he didn't have as big a\ndrove of 'em as de other plantation owners, but child we could hear\nniggahs hollen' every night on different plantations all around us from\nlashings dey gittin' from dere old overseers and masters too, for dat\nmatter.\n\n\n\"My owner raised mostly cotton and corn, my mother wove all de clothes\nwe wore, she even done all de spinning. During de Civil War, my old Miss\nuse to hide us niggahs in de woods to keep de Yankees from seein' us.\nDey pass through our place and got most all our stock just de same and\nall dey wanted to eat besides. But dey never found a one of us. After\ndey pass by we all go on back home.\n\n\n\"Dey sent us to church reglar and de preacher say to us, any you all see\nanybody stealin' old Miss chickens or eggs, go straight to old Miss and\ntell her who 'tis and all about it. Any one steal old Marse hogs or\nanything belong to old Marse, go straight to him and tell him all about\nit. Den he ask us, what your daddy bring home to you when he come, and\nwhat he feed you chillun at night. We scared to death to tell anything\n'cause, honey, if we did de niggah get a killin, and our mammy tie up\nour feet and hang us upside down by our feet, build a fire under us and\nsmoke us, scare us plum to death. We swear mammy goin' to burn us up.\nLord, child, dat was an awful scare. Yes, mam, it was. De old preacher\ntold us go on work hard, tell old Miss and old Master de truth and when\nwe die God going let us in heaven's kitchen and sit down and rest from\nall dis work we doin' down here.\n\n\n\"We believe dat den. We didn't know no better, honest we didn't, honey.\nOur old Miss used to tell us, I want all my niggers to always tell de\ntruth. If dey kill you, die telling de truth. But bless your soul, our\nmammy done smoked 'nough of us up side down, to not tell dem white folks\nnothin', a lie, nor the truth. No sir'ree. Who want to get smoked up\nlikely to burn up hanging there as not. Now ain't dat so? No, sir, tell\ndem white folks, dey find out anything, they jes' find out by\nthemselves, dat's it. I never did read or write. I been married three\ntimes. My last husband I married October 31, 1901 and moved right out\nhere in dis house November 6, 1901, been here ever since. My husband\nbeen dead now 18 years. My children all died while dey was babies. I had\nsix children. I wear glasses sometimes, but I praise God I can see good\nwithout glasses.\n\n\n\"De government gives me a pension and I git along fairly middlin'. Since\npeace been declared I made my living doing laundry work and cooking. I\nnursed right smart in Memphis. My mother died in 1893 here in St. Louis.\nHer name was Eliza Mullin, but I never did know how old she was. She\ndidn't neither. I am a Baptist and go to church reglar as I kin, but I\nsuffer so hard with indigestion. I can't go no place much. Guess dat's\n'bout all I can remember worth 'membering, hope it helps de book out.\"",

She kum ta\nMissouri as a girl an frum dat time on she wuz a slabe fur John Hill,\nour boss. She worked thar till our freedom. Our family had three boys,\nPeter, William, and me an two girls, Sallie and Malinda. We bunked up in\na cabin with one room. All us kids ate on da flo frum da same plate an\nda biggest dog got da mos. We generally wore a straight slip like a\nnightgown an hit fastened round the neck. (In the old South boys were\ndressed in this fashion until about ten years old and were called\n\"shirttail boys\".) Tak dis off an we war naked.\n\n\n\"The ole lady, the wife ob da Boss was da devil's sister. Her name was\n'Whip'. She beat da ole folks mor'n tha kids. She used tha cowhide an we\ngot a lickin' whether we did anythin' or not. We had ta git up early an\nafter given supper we war put ta bed an did not 'pilfer' round. We had\nta go on Sunday ta the Boss' Church, tha Carmelite or Christian Church.\nMa muthuh wuz no han ta tell big yarns an so I know no ghost stories. We\nwuz raised very sensible. Tha white folks did not help us ta read an\nwrite. I learned that after we war free. I never did go ta school. Our\ngames was 'Wolf on tha Bridge', an 'King-Kong-Ko.' We always had ta be\ndoin' somethin', even if it war pickin' up kindlin'.\n\n\n\"I member when Price's army kum thro here in '64 or '65 on their way ta\nPilot Knob. I wuz 'bout six or seben years ole. I an ma sister had bin\ndown ta the white childr'n school ta take them dinner. We had ta bring\ntha basket bak an we sat down in tha corner ob da graveyard ta eat whut\nwuz left in da basket. Da graveyard was nex to da Fredericktown road and\njus across frum our house. All at onc't I heard the mos' turrible noise\nan saw soldiers kum up da road. We war sure scared. We jumped up, ran\ncross da road, jumped over da fence an begun ta tak out fur da house. Da\nsoldiers laughed an said somethin. One soldier on a horse kum up ta de\nfence, tore off da top rail, an with his horse jumped ober da fence, an\ntook out after us, but he nebber cud catch us. We wuz sho runnin'. I wuz\ncarryin' da basket and if I had a throwed it down we would a showed that\nsoldier some runnin'. Da soldier turned his horse round but we went\nstraight to da house to da Missus. She say dat dey was only havin' a\ngood time an would not hurt us. We stood at da house an looked, an it\ntook 'bout all afternoon fur da soldiers to pass. Thar war horses,\nwagons and cannons. Da soldiers durin' da war took all da Boss' horses\naway an he had only a yoke ob oxen lef.\n\n\n\"After da freedom we all had ta get out an work. We had a big family. I\nwork'd at da lead smelter at Mine La Motte in 1872 an work'd thar fur\nsix years. I made $2.50 a day an dat was good wages then. I batched\nthar. I larned ta read at Mine La Motte when a white man taught me in\nevenin's at da mine between shifts. Afterwards I work'd in Bonne Terre\nat da smelter but got lead colic an quit thar.\n\n\n\"I think slavery wuz a curse on human nature. I believe in nobody bein'\nin bondage ob no kind. Da Almighty wuz not a goin' ta let slavery las'\nmuch longer. You know whut He did about da people in Egypt.\"\n\n\n(Note--Louis Hill lives in a very nice home. He is a quiet negro, and\nexcept for a short time, has spent his entire life in Farmington. He\nreceives an Old Age Pension. I did not inquire about his marriage, for,\nfrom knowledge I have gained, he lives with a colored woman to whom he\nis not married.)\n\n\n    *Interview with Louis Hill,*\n    *Farmington, Missouri.*\n\n\n    _He Swapped Liquor For Lessons_\n\n\nHow he traded liquor for lessons in reading, writing, and arithmetic is\none of the interesting facts of his younger life recalled in an\ninterview recently obtained from Louis Hill, an ex-slave, now living in\nFarmington, Missouri.\n\n\nLouis believes that the government should have made some provision for\nthe aid of the Negroes during the early struggle following their\nemancipation.\n\n\nRegarding the part which he takes in politics, Louis declares that his\ninvariable rule is to \"look over de field and vote for what he thinks is\nde best timber.\"\n\n\nThe story of his experiences as given to the interviewer is told as\nclosely as possible in his own words which follow:\n\n\n\"I was too young to know what to expect from freedom. My mother picked\nup and left de white folks in de night and took us kids with her. Dat\nwas after we was free but dey wouldn't let her get away in de daytime\nvery handy. Dey did not pay my mother anything after she was free. In\ndem days kids didn't question de old folks like they does now, so I\ndidn't find out much. Dere was two sisters, two brothers and myself what\nleft dat night with my mother. We all had some bundles, and when we left\nde old mistress in de dark we went to some neighbors several blocks\naway. We didn't have to go far away 'cause dey could not force you to go\nback after we was free. But my mother did go back and work for de\nmistress a good while but she got paid den. We stayed here for quite\nawhile and den went up to Valle Mines.\n\n\n\"I piddled around and hired out for first one and den another and did\nwhat a kid could do. When you earned any money dem days you had to give\nit to your mother and didn't know what she done with it. About de first\nwork I done was for Mr. Boyer, a Frenchman, up in Valle Mines in de\ndiggin's. I dug mineral, zinc, etc. I got 50 cents a day. He did all de\ndiggin and I 'coached' it from de head of the drift to de shaft. I had a\nlittle car on wheels dat run on a wooden track. I reckon I worked for\nhim 'bout two years. My mother would go out to de big dirt pile called\n'scrappin' and would pick out de zinc and lead chunks and little pieces.\n\n\n\"Purt near every Saturday we would take de ore down to Furnace Town and\nget it weighed and get a check for it. Den we come back to Farmington\nafter several years and lived with my sister's husband and worked around\nat a little bit of everything. I was gettin' to be a pretty good sized\nboy and went to Mine La Motte and worked on de furnace. My first work at\ndat place was at $2 a day and later on I became a 'charger' and got\n$2.50 a day. I stayed with dem six or seven years. After I left dere I\nwent to Bonne Terre and got married and got mine sickness or lead colic\nfrom workin' in de furnace and had to quit. I come back to Farmington\nand is been here ever since. Den I worked at sawing wood, chopping wood,\nand at a soda factory and beer depot and peddled ice and delivered soda\nand beer to Knob Lick, Syenite, Graniteville and Bonne Terre. I worked\nhere for a long time.\n\n\n\"I'se had four children and two is livin. De boy is in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia and the girl is in Seattle, Washington. My boy is a chauffeur\nfor an old, rich feller by de name of Clark and he has been in de same\njob for 16 years. He gets $100 a month, room and board. He's been\nwanting to quit but de old man won't let him. My son's daughter does de\ncooking for dis rich guy. My son is 56 years old now.\n\n\n\"My daughter is 54 and is married. What she does is more dan I can tell\nyou. Her husband was a soldier in de regular army, in de 10th Cavalry,\nand was in de Philippines, and Cuba and so my daughter is been around\nsome. She been away from here for about 23 or 24 years.\n\n\n\"I think de young Negroes need settling down and have more education and\nnot so much good time. I didn't have much of a chance. We was turned\nloose barefooted and had no schools den and when dey had schools I had\nto work. But in Mine La Motte a Mr. McFarland would come over to our\ncabin and teach me readin', writin' and 'rithmetic. He was an awful\ndrinker but was smart. I would give him a little something to drink for\nteachin' me. I took lessons for 'bout a year. I sure do like to read de\nnewspapers now and can write letters. The young generation thinks too\nmuch about goin' and having a good time. A little 'task master' wouldn't\nhurt de young people. I wasn't in de slavery long enough for it to hurt\nme none. I was free when I was 5 years old. My mother, however, was\nworked like an old horse and de best part of her life was spent in\nbondage.\n\n\n\"I believe de government should have made some provision for de slaves\nwhen dey turned dem loose. De government could have compelled\nslaveholders to give slaves a little track of land, a cow and a horse\nand give 'em a start. De slave had made what de white man had. I\nactually believe de Negroes would be better off today if they had done\ndis. My old mistress just had oodles of land. Of course de white folks\nwas not used to work and dere was plenty for de Negroes to do if dey\nwanted to work.\n\n\n\"I voted as soon as I got a chance. De first time I voted was in 1880.\nI'se had 'em try to pay me to vote but I told dem my vote was not for\nsale. You know you ain't dictated to unless you is 'wishy washy'. Once,\na feller asked me how I voted. I said, 'Just to suit myself.' I\ngenerally look over de field and vote for what I think is de best\ntimber. Dey is goin' to have a hot time in 1940, for dem that lives to\nsee it. It's a free country and a man should not have to own property in\norder to vote. Dey ought not to oppress anyone.\"",

According to her story she was 17\nyears old when the Civil War ended. Her mother and father were slaves\nand both of them had died before the beginning of the conflict. She\nbelieves that she is part Indian as her great grandmother is believed to\nhave been an Indian squaw.\n\n\nThe following is her own version of events which played a part in her\nlife during her slave days and since that time:\n\n\n\"When dey turned me loose I was naked, barefoot, and didn't have nothin'\nto start out on. They turned us loose without a thing and we had to\nkinda pick ourselves up. We would go out of a Sunday and dig ginseng and\nlet it dry for a week and sell it to de store. We would make about a\ndollar every Sunday dat way, and den we'd get our goods at de store. The\nmaster and all de boys was killed in de war and de mistress married some\n'hostle jostle' who helped to kill the boss. I was jus' not goin' to\nstand dat so dis was when I left home.\n\n\n\"Abraham Lincoln done put a piece in de paper saying dat all de slaves\nwas free and if dey whipped any of de slaves after dey was set free dey\nwould prosecute them. Me and another little old woman done some shoutin'\nand hollerin' when we heard 'bout de freedom. We tore up some corn down\nin de field. De old missus was right there on de fence but wouldn't dare\ntouch us den. Once de mistress struck me after we was freed and I\ngrabbed her leg and would have broke her neck. She wanted to apologize\nwith me de way she had treated me but I would not let her. They thought\nit was awful dat dey could not whip de slaves any longer.\n\n\n\"I den worked from one farm to another. I would stay a year or two each\nplace. Dey wanted me to stay. Dey said I was de best plow boy dey had. I\nwould cut de old roots and dey would pop but dey paid me nothin' and dey\ndidn't give you no clothes. We got so much in de share of de cropping\nbut dey would not share with me so I would leave. So I come to\nFredericktown to try to find my mother's people but when I got here dey\ndone told me dey was gone to Illinois.\n\n\n\"I den come right out of de field and went right into the dining room. I\nwas never turned off from any of my work. I would just work 'till I got\ntired and quit. Talk about bein' happy! We was sure 'nough some happy\npeople when dey done took dat yoke offen our necks. Before I was free we\nhad to shuck three wagon loads of corn a day. De wagon would hold 40\nbushels. I'd come home and my fingers would be twisted from so much\nwork. De oxen would slobber all over de corn before we picked it. It was\ncold out dere in de field an' I would wrap my feet up in my dress and\nwait till de wagon would drive up. I had no shoes on. Man, I don't know\nhow I'm here today. It just was de mercy of God that took care of me.\nWhen my mother was dying she done asked God to look over us and it must\nhave been her prayer dat helped me to still be here.\n\n\n\"When my mother was sick once de doctor come and brought his wife. De\nwife always come with de doctor. De doctor would not allow de family to\ngive de medicine, 'cause he said de family would give in to de sick\nperson. De wife of de doctor would give de medicine when de doctor was\nasleep. I never seen de family give medicine till I come up here. De\ndoctors always come and stay till de sick person was out of danger and\nde wife always come with him.\n\n\n\"Lord, people nowadays don't know nothing 'bout nothin'. Child, I spun\nbackwards and forwards to de wheel till I wore my feet out till de balls\nof my feet was wore to de blood.\n\n\n\"Lots of slaves went to Illinois after freedom, but I never been out of\nde State. I don't go to frolics of any kind. I just come here and\nsettled down and never rambled 'round. I've lived in dis house 55 years\nand have buried purty near all my family right out of dis house. I ain't\nnever had a fuss with any of my neighbors, and I done took de bitter\nwith de sweet. I ride in an automobile only to funerals. I ain't been on\na train but once or twice and dat was 'bout 40 years ago. I'm interested\nin church now, can sit and listen to preachin' and singin' all day, but\nI sets right here while dey has all dis other excitement. It's been\nseventy years since I done been to Farmington to a picnic. I don't want\nde pension so much to roam around but to be protected in my old age and\nto have a few more days of peace. I don't care nothin' about clothes.\n\n\n\"I been votin' at that thing ever since it started. Dey would take me a\nfree ride when votin' time comes. You can't turn around for dey wants to\ntake you to vote. But after de voting dey won't pay no attention to me.\nI never did vote only a straight ticket and I always went my own way.\nDey would sometimes tell me how to vote but I didn't pay them no mind.\nMy husband did not believe in women voting and he said it would tear up\nde country. He said he wanted to be in heaven when de women voted.\nGarfield was de first president I ever voted for.\n\n\n\"I believe it would been better to have moved all de colored people way\nout west to dem selves. Abraham Lincoln wanted to do dis. It would have\nbeen better on both races and dey would not have mixed up. But de white\npeople did not want de 'shade' taken out of de country. Many of de\nbosses after de freedom couldn't stand it and went in de house and got a\ngun and blew out his brains. If Lincoln had lived he would have\nseparated us like dey did de Indians. We would not have been\nslaughtering, burning, hanging, and killin' if we had been put to\nourselves, and had our own laws. Many a person is now in torment because\nof dis mixup. God give us a better principle and we could have had\nthousands of whites slaughtered but we didn't after the freedom.\n\n\n\"De present generation is a lost condition. If dey don't girdle their\nlines and pull dem up closer and ask God to help 'em and quit going to\ndem 'hog holes' and drinkin' it is going to be death and destruction.\nDis not only is true of the Negroes but white folks, too. Mother and\nfather think it is alright. Dese undertakers is goin' out all de time,\nnight and day, on the highways and pickin' up de carcass of people. It's\nsin dat is wrong with de world. De future of the Negro is of the past.\nWe have some good friends among the white folks but de devil is just got\nso strong dat de good can't hardly stand. We have some good citizens in\ndis town. I can't read or write but I used to have the white lady read\nthe funny side of the paper when I set down to eat.\n\n\n\"Once during de war de soldiers was around me very thick. I was coming\nback from carryin' de dinner out in de woods to Sam Hildebrand. I took\nhim a table cloth, napkins and everything first class. I went down to de\nhouse and hid de basket in a hollow log and crossed de creek and dey\nhollered, 'Halt!' De soldiers was cussin' me like a bay steer. Dey said,\n'I'll kill you right here and blow your brains out if you don't tell.' I\ntold dem I had been up dere to water de calves so dey give me my pass\nand let me go on to de house. I would not tell dem nothin' 'bout Sam\nHildebrand nor where he was hiding. While Sam et his meal I would stand\n'round and watch in de woods. I was de oldest one on de place and I was\nde only one what had to carry his meals to him.\n\n\n\"I would get up many mornings and hear the bugler blowin'. Das when dey\nwas callin' the pickets in. You would see de pickets come in just\na-flyin' and out sent de fresh pickets on duty. I was not scared of dem.\nSometimes de soldiers stayed 'round our place for two weeks and camped.\nDey was about 500 and de men laid out on de ground under a government\nwagon and in some houses around about. Dese soldiers would go out with\nsabers and whack de heads off of de sheep, hogs, and calves and in about\nfive minutes would have dat yearlin' skinned and dash it into de boilin'\nkettle. Den dey would take a long knife and cut off a big piece of meat\nwith the blood runnin' out. Dey did not cook de meat done and did not\nput much salt on it. It sure was funny, seein' dem soldiers eatin' a big\nhunk of meat with de blood runnin' out. Dey always had bread but don't\nknow where dey got it. They was so tired and wore out and their feet was\nsore and de infantry was almost barefooted. Dey was always dressed in\nblue. Sometimes we would have 30 or 40 yards of goods on de loom and dey\nwould tear it off and send it home to their family. We was glad enough\nto get dem to take dis and get out. There would not be a man on de place\nwhen these 500 soldiers come. We always managed to bury dat gentleman\n(money). I can remember the boss took out of his chest his money, enough\nto fill the table, and put it in a buck skin bag and he went off with\nanother man. I don't know what become of de money and dey was killed and\nthere was no one left to tell de tale.\n\n\n\"I sure had it rough and tumble since de war. Of course I don't have a\nboss now. I've worked on de farm, as a dining room girl, washin',\nironing, and hiring out. I would get about $9 to $10 a week. I was\nworkin' for de railroad people den when de road was runnin' strong here.\nMy husband he died 40 years ago and he done left me with about 15 cents,\nand the mortgage on dis house was about $130. I had a wagon worth about\n$40 and old Dr. Newberry took dat for his bill. Den I would do two or\nthree washings before I come home and would come by de undertaker's and\nleave him some money on de funeral. My daughter is a grass widow and she\nlives here. Her ex-husband shines shoes down town, but he don't help us\nnone. My daughter has got three children.\n\n\n\"I don't go to church lately. It's embarrassing to go in this hot\nweather. I know where I want dem to bury me. All the old folks buried\nout at de old colored cemetery.\n\n\n\"I goes down here to de store and if I can't get de money dey waits till\nI can, I can get it on a credit. Dey think Aunt Rhody is one of the\nleadin' persons of de town. Of course I don't run all over town but go\nto one store. Dey have got used to me and dey know it sometimes takes an\nhour for me to make up my mind what I want to buy. When I go to de store\nthey kid me and say: 'Why, Aunt Rhody, ain't you dead yet? You is goin'\nto outlive us all.'\n\n\n\"Slavery learnt me how to work and I wasn't feared of no kind of work.\nMost of de people around here don't know nothin' 'bout work. A little\nslavery would do dis young age some good and dey is goin' to get it. Dis\nyoung generation is slaughtering our people up, down in de south. Our\npeople don't know what freedom is down there. Better not go down there\nand talk about freedom. My brother went down there in the south and got\nback so far from de river dat he never got out. I guess de exposure and\nthe beatin' killed him. Lots of places dey votes down there, but de\nvotes is thrown in de waste basket and dey don't count. These people\ncan't beat up us people and jump up on a bed and close their eyes and\ndie and expect to go to heaven.\n\n\n\"I ain't never heard de Bible read till I was free in Fredericktown.\nWhen we was slaves we did not have much time to get out and sin much.\nDis generation is goin' to destruction. It's all on account of not\nminding their parents. Dey is just hard-headed. It's caused by de way de\nold folks acted and is bein' put on dis present generation. I tell 'em,\nyou don't think dat you can walk these streets and fall dead and never\nsaid nothin' to God to move this gulf of sin and den expect to go to\nHeaven. I'm tryin' to serve God and fightin' all de time against de\ndevil to keep him from knockin' me over. I'm not a person to go on with\na lot of nonsense. I talk to de young people all de time around de\nstores and tell 'em dey is got to get up from there to make it across de\nriver. Dey all talk about me preachin' a sermon around de stores. But de\ndevil's already got de 'bill of sale' on dem. I'm talkin' to de Lord all\nde time cause my stay is going to be mighty short now.\"\n\n\n    *\"Aunt Rhody\" Holsell,*\n    *Fredericktown, Missouri.*\n    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*\n\n\n\"I've lived in Fredericktown ever since de war and only two or three\ntimes I've been out of hollering distance of town. I was seventeen years\nold when de war was over. My boss was Thos. McGee in Wayne County. My\nmother and father were slaves. My great-grandmother was a Indian squaw.\nMy mother was dead four years 'fore de war and my father was dead three\nyears.\n\n\n\"I sure can 'member 'bout de war. De funniest thing was some soldiers\ncamped at our house. Man, I would pull weeds in de cotton patch, and\nwhen I got a little older I was a-carding and spinning and dat wheel was\na-singing. I spun all de chain all through de Civil War and I spun all\nde warp. De boss treated us very good. De boss would know every row of\ncorn we would hoe; sometimes we would break de corn off and den we got a\nwhipping with a weed.\n\n\n\"De boss lost all three of his boys with their shoes on in de war, but\ndey did not join de army. De boss was also killed. De boss had a race\nhorse and de soldiers found dis out an de boss tried to get de hoss out\nof de state to New Orleans until after de war. My brother got de race\nhoss down there all right. My brother got on Knight and rode clear to\nCape and his closes were torn off. He get to Cape just as de boat was\npulling out. Dey killed de boss when he got on another hoss an he was\nshot 'cause de soldiers thought he was on de race hoss. Dey killed de\nboss in August on Monday. De boss was going that day to Greenville to\nmake his will.\n\n\n\"After de war I worked my way to Fredericktown. I started out bareheaded\nan barefooted. I worked from one farm to another. I worked at one farm\nfor two years and at another for one year. These people paid me a\nlittle. It took 'bout five years 'fore I got to Fredericktown. I did\nanything. I cradled five acres of oats and my husband bound it. I didn't\nfear no kind of boss. I have ten great grand-children, and one\ngreat-great-grandchild.\n\n\n\"I took Sam Hildebrand's dinner to him many times and when Sam was\nkilled in Southern Illinois dey tried to get me to go up to Farmington\nto identify him. But I would not do it. I told dem dat he had a mark\nbehind his shoulder dat dey could see. I 'member once when Sam\nHildebrand was shot and came to our place to have his sore washed out. I\nheld de wash pan for old Tom McGee to wash his wound.\n\n\n\"De old folks had all kinds of tea to heal people. De old mistress took\nde 'ridicue' [TR: reticule] with her and would be gone for a week going\nfrom one sick person to another. My boss caused my mother's death. She\nwas on a wagon of oats and was being pulled by a yoke of oxen. De wagon\nturned and she fell off on a sapling and it went through her skin and\ndey had to saw de sapling off and she had to lay with dat snag in her\nside till de doctor twenty miles away come. It was in August and she\ndied with poison. Her coffin was made right out on de work bench. Dey\ndidn't have anything in de coffin but a winding sheet scolloped nicely\nand a shroud for de body. It was a miracle to me when I came up here to\nsee how dey dressed up de dead people. When I die just wrap me in a\nclean sheet. That was what my fore-parents had. It's better to think\nwhar dat soul is. Two wheel carts was mostly used at funerals in those\ndays with oxen. The driver would be walking along beside driving.\n\n\n\"De Boss said one man was treated mean and they could not do anything\nwith him. The old fellow would play his gourd and de snakes would come\n'round. Finally dey sent him down to New Orleans and sold him on de\nblock.\n\n\n\"If you move on Saturday you won't stay long. If de boss decides about\nyou on Tuesday or Friday these are hanging days. I can't read or write\nbut I have a little mother sense. We have three spirits, evil spirit in\nde grave, another spirit which is wandering, and a spirit in heaven.\n\n\n\"I think slavery is good for dem dat understands it. We are all slaves\nnow. We have a rough and tumble business. Slavery was cruel but it's\nabout as bad now. Them days they didn't hang anybody for doing bad\nthings. I may be wrong. I been voting ever since de mess got up. My\nhusband said he wanted to be in heaven when de women would be messin'\n'round among de men and voting. I wish we had a whole lot of Abraham\nLincolns now. He did a great deed when he took de yoke off us colored\npeople. We will get a little rest anyway.\"",

        "text": "The subject of this sketch is Henry Johnson, over ninety years of age,\nliving at 1526 Hanley Road, Lincoln Terrace, St. Louis, Missouri. Henry\nis of dark complexion and has a wealth of long white hair and feminine\nfeatures.\n\n\nHis eyesight is good. He is in excellent health for his age. The old man\nadmits that his main weakness is chewing tobacco. He was seated in the\nliving room of his 4-room, old fashioned frame cottage which is poorly\nfurnished, but clean, where he lives with his wife, at least twenty-five\nyears younger than himself. His story follows:\n\n\n\"My name is Henry Johnson. I was born in Patrick County, Virginia and\nwas raised all over de state. I was only sold twice. My father's name\nwas Bill Alexander and my mother's name was Fannie, but I didn't know\nnothin' 'bout my parents till I was past eighteen years old or about\nthat. I never knowed my real age. My owner's name was Billy Johnson in\nPatrick County so I always carried his name. When I was a little bit 'a\nfellow, I used to pack water to twenty-five and thirty men in one field,\nden go back to de house and bring enough water for breakfast de next\nmorning. When I got a little bigger, I had to take a little hoe and dig\nweeds out of de crop. If our white boss see a little grass we overlooked\nhe would handcuff our feet to a whipping post, den chain the slave\naround de stomach to de post and strap de chin over de top of de post\nand place your hands in front of you.\n\n\n\"In de start de slave has been stripped naked, and lashed, often to\ndeath. Dey would be left strapped after from twenty-five to fifty lashes\nevery two or three hours to stand dere all night. De next day, de\noverseer would be back with a heavy paddle full of holes that had been\ndipped in boiling water and beat until de whole body was full of\nblisters. Den he'd take a cat-o'-nine-tails dipped in hot salt water to\ndraw out de bruised blood and would open everyone of dem blisters with\ndat. If de slave did not die from dat torture, he would be unfastened\nfrom de whipping post, and made go to de field just as he was. Often\ntimes he would die shortly after. Dey did the women de same.\"\n\n\nHere he showed the writer scars on his head and shoulders which he said\nwere from those beatings.\n\n\n\"I never knowed what a shirt was until I was past twenty. When my young\nmaster went three miles to school, he rode on a horse, I had to walk\nalong side de horse to carry his books, den go home and fetch him a hot\ndinner for noon and go back after him at night to carry dem books.\n\n\n\"My boss had eleven children. He had one hundred and twenty-five slaves\non one of de plantations, two hundred on another. On all his plantations\nhe owned better'n 1500 slaves. He was one of de richest land owners in\nde state of Virginia. He often told me I was born just one hour before\nhis youngest son. I stayed with dat family until way after de war was\nfought.\n\n\n\"Dey would take a great string of slaves in de road on Sunday and make\nus walk to church. Buggies with de white folks in would be in front of\nus, in de midst of us, and all betwixt and behind us. When we got dat\nfour or five miles we had to sit on a log in de broiling sun, while a\nwhite man preached to us. All dey evah would say would be niggers obey\nyour masters and mistress and don't steal from 'em. And lo and behold,\nhoney, de masters would make us slaves steal from each of the slave\nowners. Our master would make us surround a herd of his neighbor's\ncattle, round dem up at night, and make us slaves stay up all night long\nand kill and skin every one of dem critters, salt the skins down in\nlayers in de master's cellar, and put de cattle piled ceilin' high in de\nsmoke house so nobody could identify skinned cattle.\n\n\n\"Den when de sheriff would come around lookin' for all dem stolen\ncritters, our boss would say, 'Sheriff, just go right on down to dem\nniggahs' cabins and search dem good, I know my niggers don't steal.'\nCourse de sheriff come to our cabins and search, sure we didn't have\nnothin' didn't belong to us, but de boss had plenty. After de sheriff's\nsearch, we had to salt and smoke all dat stolen meat and hang it in old\nmarse smoke house for him. Den dey tell us, don't steal. Dey raised\nturkeys in de 500 lots and never did give us one. So we wanted one so\nbad once, I put corn underneath de cabin and a turkey, a great big one,\nwould come under our cabin to eat dat corn. One day when I got a chance\nI caught dat old gobbler by de neck and him and me went round and round\nunder dat old cabin house. He was de biggest strongest bird I ever see,\nI was only a boy but finally I beat. I twisted his neck till he died.\nDen I took out up to de big house, fast as anything, to tell my old miss\none of our finest turkeys dead. She said stop cryin' Henry and throw him\nunder de hill. I was satisfied. I run back, picked dat ole bird, taken\nall his feathers to de river and throwed dem in. Dat night we cooked\nhim, and didn't we eat somethin' good. I had to tell her 'bout dat\nmissin' bird 'cause when dey check up it all had to tally so dat fixed\ndat.\n\n\n\"My old master told me when de war was being fought and the Yankees was\non de way coming through Franklin County, Virginia, 'My little niggah,\ndo you know how old you is?' I said: 'No sah, boss.' He said: 'You are\nseventeen years old.' I never even saw my mother and father until I was\nin my twenties. A white man taken me to Danville, Virginia to drive his\ncarriage for him. After I was dere a spell a colored man kept watching\nme so much I got plum scared. Dis was after de war was over. Den one\nday, lo and behold, he jumped at me and he grabbed me and asked me where\nwas I staying. I did not know whether to tell him or not, I was so\nscared. Den he said I am your father and I am goin' to take you to your\nmother and sisters and brothers down in Greenville, Virginia. When he\ngot me dere, I found two sisters and four brothers. Dey was all so glad\nto see me dey shouted and cried and carried on so I was so scared I\ntried to run away, 'cause I didn't know nothin' 'bout none of them. And\nI thought dat white man what brought me down here ought to have saved me\nfrom all dis. I just thought a white man was my God, I didn't know no\nbetter.\n\n\n\"Well, when my folks finally stopped rejoicing, my mother only had two\nchickens. She killed and cooked dem for me. My father and brothers would\ngo to work every day and leave me at home with my mother for over a\nyear. They would not trust me to work, feared I would run off 'cause I\ndidn't no nothin' 'bout them. Hadn't even heard of a mother and father.\nMy brother and father would work all day and only get one peck of corn\nor one pound of meat or one quart of molasses for a whole day's work\nfrom sun up till sun down. We had to grind dat corn for our flour, and\ngot biscuits once a year at Christmas and den only one biscuit apiece.\n\n\n\"After a little better'n a year after I come, the white man told my\nfather to bring his family and move from Greenhill, Virginia to Patrick\nCounty, Virginia to his big farm, and farm dere for him and he would\ngive him one half of all he raised for his share. We went, and did we\nraise a big crop. He kep' his word all right and we stayed dere till de\nwhite man died five years later. Den we went to another farm. We had\ncleared enough in the five years to buy us a fine pair of oxen and had\nmoney besides. So we went to another farm and went to work giving the\nowner of the farm one third of the crop and kep' two thirds ourselves.\nWe stayed there two years. Then father sold de oxen and went to\nSweetville, Virginia and bought $200 worth of land and stayed about five\nyears. We made our crop with a hoe and made good. Den I left home and\nrun about all over, learned how to play a violin and made my livin' with\nit for a long time.\n\n\n\"I quit dat and railroaded about eight years working on sections and new\ngrading. Den went to Decatur, Alabama and worked with a land company\nputting down pipings about three months. I quit dat and married Anna\nJohnson and come to Giles County, Tennessee. We had one son.\n\n\n\"I came to St. Louis from Tennessee more dan forty years ago. I got work\nright away at Cycle & Harris Steel Plant on 18th Street and worked dere\nabout six months, when I got scalded almost to death on the job. I got a\nnew nose and a new ear from dat accident. All de flesh of my right arm\nwas off to de bone. I was in de hospital eight months from it and I got\n$500 out of de damage suit. I bought me a horse and wagon out of it and\ndone light hauling, and moved out here in Lincoln Terrace and been out\nhere ever since.\n\n\n\"I landscaped out here for sixteen years until I was disabled to work\nhard any more. I got a garden but I can't make any money from it, 'cause\nall de other folks out here got gardens too. I am a deacon in Mt. Zion\nBaptist Church right here at de corner. Rev. Thomas is my pastor.\n\n\n\"I only went to school three days in my whole life but a colored friend\ntaught me how to spell out of a blue back spelling book. His name was\nCharlie Snowball. I was learning fine until I got burned. Den my eye\nsight was poor for a long time, but I see now very good. I only need\nglasses for to read what little I can read. I can't write at all. My\ngrandfather was 135 years old when he died, and my father lived to be\n135.\n\n\n\"De white people in Missouri sure have been mighty good to me since I\nbeen here. I have as nice clothes as any man in St. Louis, good clothes\nwhat I mean. All been given' to me by white people able to give\nsomethin'. I have not had to buy a hat, shoes or suit of clothes for\nover twenty-five years, and got far more good clothes dan I can ever\nwear out till my dying day. I think these 20th century white folks dat\nhave principle are trying to make amends to Negroes to make up for the\nmeanness their foreparents done to us, so I try to forgive 'em all in my\nheart for the sake of a few good ones now. I've buried two wifes from\ndis very house. I am now living with my third wife and she is a mighty\nfine woman. We have been together about sixteen years.\"",

Her story follows:\n\n\n\"The niggers had three or four wifes before de war, as many as dey could\nbear chillun by. But after de war dey had to take one woman and marry\nher. My mother had three chillun by him and de odder wifes had three and\nfour chillun too. Old man, Ben Oil raised my mother. He was an old\nbachelor but his brothers were all married.\n\n\n\"Ben Oil had 100 niggers. He just raised niggers on his plantation. His\nbrother-in-law, John Cross raised niggers, too. He had 125 niggers. He\nhad a nigger farm. His other brother-in-law we call old man English, had\n100 niggers. Dey all jes' had nothin' else but niggers. Before de war\nbroke out, Tom Oil and John Oil come up dah and taken all us niggers but\neight and eight acres of land he left for Ben Oil's housekeeper. Old\nMarse Ben died and after dat Tom carried us all back down der to New\nOrleans wid him and opened up a nigger pen. Dat's a place like a stock\nyard where dey auction us off. De old ones was de ones dey was anxious\nto get shet of. We only know our ages by known' we is born in corn\nplantin' and cotton pickin' time. We never even knowed de days of de\nweek.\n\n\n\"I had three aunts to die in all dat huddle of niggers. De doctors make\nus go walking every day 'cause dat was de only exercise we git. One of\ndem aunts dropped dead on de street while walking. De other two died in\nde slave pen. My grandmother was a fine seamstress. She sewed all de\nsewing for de white folks. Three days after her first baby was born dey\nmade her git up and make twelve stiff-front, tucked white shirts for her\nold mistress' boy who be goin' off to college and she was so sick and\nweak, some of de stitches was crooked. Old Miss ordered de overseer to\ntake her out and beat her 'bout it. Before he did de doctor looked at\nher and said 'tain't no use beatin' her she won't do you no more good.\nShe's stone blind, but she can have chillun right on. So dey kept her\nfor dat and she bore twelve more head of chillun after dat.\n\n\n\"My mother was black as a crow and her hair was so long she could sit on\nit. Dey brought a huddle of niggers over amongst de Indians from all\nover de south and Maryland and intermarried 'em wid dere own sisters,\nbrothers, cousins, nieces and de like. De niggers didn't know for years\ndey was any kin. When dey want to raise certain kind a breed of chillun\nor certain color, dey just mixed us up to suit dat taste, and tell de\nnigger dis is your wife or dis is your husband and dey take each other\nand not know no better and raise big families to de white folks liking.\n\n\n\"I never can forget one Sunday morning de rebels come into Cape\nGirardeau. De old Miss what raised me had just killed two hogs and put\n'em in de smoke house. I got up bright and early dat Sunday morning. I\nlooked out toward de smoke house and seed two white men out dere dressed\nin blue clothes and dey just went in Old Miss' smoke house and help dem\nselves. I run right fast and told old Miss what was going on out der in\nher smoke house. But dere wasn't no men folks around so we couldn't help\nourselves. Dey told us dey was 300 strong and just den some others come\nover de hill and told 'em come on, hurry up so dey climbed de hill in a\nhurry leaving dere. They had three gun boats and dey turned one of dem\nthings loose up der as dey was goin' and Lawd child dat thing destroyed\nproperty for miles around.\n\n\n\"Some of dem rebels had ball bats, some had sticks, some riding and some\nwalking. Dey killed three of us niggers in our camp dat morning. All de\nnigger men been taken away just leaving us nigger women and chillun. Dey\nburned down frame and log huts just de same.

We belonged to Will Ely. He had only\nfive slaves, my father and mother and three of us girls. I was only\neight or nine years old. De Elys had eight children. Dere was Paula,\nAnn, Sarah, Becky, Emily, Lizzie, Will, Ike, and Frank. Lizzie was de\noldest girl and I was to belong to her when she was married.\n\n\n\"De master of de house was better to us dan de mistress. We didn't have\nto work none too hard, 'cause we was so young, I guess. We cut weeds\nalong de fences, pulled weeds in de garden and helped de mistress with\nde hoeing. We had to feed de stock, sheep, hogs, and calves, because de\nyoung masters wouldn't do de work. In de evenings we was made to knit a\nfinger width and if we missed a stitch would have to pull all the yarn\nout and do it over. De master's girls learned us to read and write. We\ndidn't have hardly no clothes and most of de time dey was just rags. We\nwent barefoot until it got real cold. Our feet would crack open from de\ncold and bleed. We would sit down and bawl and cry because it hurt so.\nMother made moccasins for our feet from old pants. Late in de fall\nmaster would go to Hannibal or Palmyra and bring us shoes and clothes.\nWe got dem things only once a year. I had to wear de young master's\noveralls for underwear and linseys for a dress.\n\n\n\"My father was took away. My mother said he was put on a block and sold\n'cause de master wanted money to buy something for de house. My mother\ntold me she come from Virginia or down south some place. Dey brought her\nin a box car with lots of other colored people. Dere was several cars\nfull, with men in one car, women in another, and de younger ones in\nanother, and de babies in another with some of the women to care for\ndem. Dey brought dem to Palmyra and sold dem. Master Ely bought my\nmother. I don't know where my father come from.\n\n\n\"Mistress always told us dat if we run away somebody would catch us and\nkill us. We was always scared when somebody strange come. De first we\nknew dere was a war was when some soldiers come through. We was sure\nscared den. Once a man come and we thought he was a patroller but he\nasked for something to eat. Mother took him to de mistress. She gave him\nsomething to eat wrapped in a paper and told him to get off de place.\n\n\n\"Some Union soldiers come and told us that we was free like dey was and\ntold us not to be afraid, dey wouldn't hurt us. Dey told us de war was\nover. De master told mother not to go away, dat if she stayed a while he\nwould give her a couple hundred dollars. We stayed a while but she never\ngot no money.\n\n\n\"We come to Hannibal in an ox wagon. We put up at de barracks and den\nmother went to live with Hiram Titchner. He lived right where de\npostoffice is now. I hired out to Mrs. James across de street for my\nclothes and schooling. Mrs. James had two girls. One of dem learned me\nnot to be such a tomboy and not to be so rough. I tell you I was a bad\ngirl when I was young. I could climb every tree on de master's farm and\nmy clothes was always in rags from being so rough. My mother used to\nwhip me most every day with a broom stick and even hit me with chairs. I\nguess I was bad. If I had a dollar for every broom handle that was laid\nacross my back I would have lots of money. I tell you we was raised\nplenty tuff dem days.\n\n\n\"De young folks can't stand such raising dese days. Dey just couldn't go\nthrough what we was through. The young folks now just couldn't do it at\nall. We never was 'lowed on the street after nine o'clock. We sure run\nfor home when the church bell done rung on de hill at nine o'clock.\nNow-a-days de young folks stays out half de night and dey steal and even\nkill each other over triflin' things. I know it 'cause I see them do\ndese things. I 'spose dere parents are a lot to blame.\n\n\n\"I was married when I was young, less dan twenty I reckon. I had one\ngirl but she is dead now. Her boy lives with me. I gets a pension, seven\ndollars a month, for about a year now. This little old shack belongs to\nme. I go to de Baptist Church over on Center Street when ever I can. We\nused to go to church on de corner 'cross from de postoffice. Dere is a\nbig store dere now.\"",

He lived in a\nbrick cabin with his wife, Aunt Lucy, on the Huntington Plantation, in\nBrazoria Co., Texas. Miss Kate Huntington says the cabin occupied by the\nold couple is part of the old slave quarters built by J. Greenville\nMcNeel, who owned the plantation before Marion Huntington. Miss Kate's\nfather bought it. Although Uncle Cinto claims to be 111, he says he was\nnamed San Jacinto because he was born during the \"San Jacinto War\",\nwhich would make his age 101.*\n\n\n\"Yes, suh, I's Cinto. That's Lucy over there, she my wife and I calls\nher Red Heifer, 'cause her papa's name was Juan and he was a Mexican.\nShe and me marry right after 'mancipation. We come long way and we goin'\nto die together.\n\n\n\"They named me San Jacinto 'cause I's born durin' de San Jacinto war,\nbut they calls me Cinto. I's born in Fort Bend County, up near Richmond,\nand my old marster was Marse Dave Randon, and his wife, Miss Nancy, was\nmy missus. She was sister to Marse John McNeel, what with his brothers\nowned all de land hereabouts.\n\n\n\"I 'members once I slips away come dark from de plantation, with some\nothers. We is slippin' 'long quiet like and a paddle roller jump out\nfrom behin' a bush and say, 'Let's see your pass.' We didn't have none\nbut I has a piece of paper and I gives it to him and he walks to where\nit am more light, and then we run, right through old burdock bushes with\nbriars stickin' us and everything. Iffen he cotched us we sho' gits a\nhidin'.\n\n\n\"I fust went to de field when I 'bout 15 year old, but they larned us to\nwork when we was chaps, we would he'p our mammas in de rows. My mamma's\nname Maria Simmons and my papa, Lewis. They rared me up right.\n\n\n\"Marse Dave wasn't mean like some. Sometimes de slaves run away to de\nwoods and iffen they don't cotch 'em fust they finally gits hongry and\ncomes home, and then they gits a hidin'. Some niggers jus' come from\nAfrica and old Marse has to watch 'em close, 'cause they is de ones what\nmostly runs away to de woods.\n\n\n\"We had better houses then, good plank houses, and de big house was sho'\nbig and nice. 'Course they didn't larn us read and write, and didn't\n'low no church, but us steal off and have it sometimes, and iffen old\nMarse cotch us he give us a whalin'. We didn't have no funerals like\nnow, they jus' dig a hole and make you a box, and throw you in and cover\nyou up. But de white folks fed us good and give us good clothes. We wore\nred russet shoes and good homespun clothes, and we done better'n now.\n\n\n\"Come Christmas time old marse sometimes give us two-bits and lots of\nextra eats. Iffen it come Monday, we has de week off. But we has to\nwatch the eats, 'cause niggers what they marsters don't give 'em no\nChristmas sneak over and eat it all up. Sometimes we have dances, and\nI'd play de fiddle for white folks and cullud folks both. I'd play,\n'Young Girl, Old Girl', 'High Heel Shoes,' and 'Calico Stockings.'\n\n\n\"When we was freed we was all glad, but I stayed 'round and worked for\nMarse Dave and he pays me a little. Finally Lucy and me gits married out\nof de Book and comes down here to Marse McNeel's. They puts us in debt\nand makes us work so many years to pay for it. They gives us our own\nground and sometimes we makes two bales of cotton on it. 'Course, we\nworks for them, too, and they pays us a little and when Christmas comes\nwe can buy our own things. I used to haul sugar and 'lasses for Papa\nJohn up to Brazoria and sometimes to Columbia.\n\n\n\"Yes, suh, I been here a long time, long time. All my own stuff is dead\nnow, I guess.

She was born a slave of the Martin family and was given\nwith her mother and family to Mary Martin, when she married John M.\nMcFarland. They lived near Tyler, Smith Co., Texas. When freed she\nremained with the McFarlands until she married A. Lewis and moved to San\nAntonio, Texas. Widowed early, she raised two sons. One, chief\nelectrical engineer with the U.S. government, lives in New York City. He\nprovides for his aged mother.*\n\n\n[HW: Illegible]\n\n\n\"I was born Jan. 12th, 1855. My first owners was the Martins, and when\ntheir daughter, Mary, married, I was give to her. My mama lived to 112\nyears old. She had sixteen children. I was the baby.\n\n\n\"Missus Mary McFarland, my mother's missus and mine, taught us children\nwith her own; learned us how to read and write. She treated us just like\nwe were her children. We had very strict leaders, my mother and Missus\nMary. She'd say, 'Mammy Lize (my mother), 'you'll have to come and whop\nOscar and Hagar, they's fightin!' Mammy Lize would say, 'No, I won't\nwhop 'em, I'll just punish 'em.' And we'd have to stand with our backs\nto each other. My missus never did much whoppin'.\n\n\n\"We lived in cabins made of logs and chinked with mud mortar. We had\nbeds that had only one leg; they fit in each corner of the walls. They\nwas strong, stout. We could jump on 'em and have lots of fun. We didn'\nstay in quarters much. The cabins was near a creek where willows grew\nand we'd make stick horses out of 'em. We called it our horse lot. On\nthe farm was a spring that threw water high, and we'd go fishing in a\nbig lake on one corner of the farm. Marster owned half a league, maybe\nmore.\n\n\n\"I was 12 years old when freed. I can remember the way my marster come\nhome from the war. The oldest son, Oscar, and I was out in the yard, and\nI saw marster first, comin' down the road, and I hollered and screamed,\n'O, Oscar, Marse John's a-comin! Marse John's a-comin' home!' We stayed\non with them 'till they all died off but Oscar.\n\n\n\"We never changed our name 'till after the Civil War. Then Marse John\nsaid, 'Mammy Lize, you gotta choose a name.' He carried us into Tyler to\na bureau or something. Mammy Lize say, 'I'm going to keep the name\nMcFarland. I ain't got no other name.'\n\n\n\"My father was a slave from another farm. My mother was the cook. She\ncooked it all in the same place for white folks and us. We ate the same,\nwhen the white folks was finished. They's a big light bread oven in the\nyard of the big house and in front of the quarters, under a big tree.\nThat one baked the pies. The cabins had a big fireplace wider than that\npiano there. They'd hang meat and sausage and dry them in the fireplace.\nCut holes in ham and hang them there. Had big hogsheads filled up with\nflour, corn and wheat.\n\n\n\"Some pore niggers were half starved. They belonged to other people.\nMissus Mary would call them in to feed 'em, see 'em outside the fence\npickin' up scraps. They'd call out at night, 'Marse John, Marse John.'\nThey's afraid to come in daytime. Marse John'd say, 'What's the matter\nnow?' They'd say, 'I'se hongry.' He'd say, 'Come in and git it.' He'd\ncure lots of meat, for we'd hear 'em hollerin' at night when they'd beat\nthe pore niggers for beggin' or stealin', or some crime.\n\n\n\"Marse John would saddle up Old Charlie and go see. He had a big shot\ngun across his lap. We'd hear that ole bull whip just a poppin'. They'd\nturn 'em loose when Marse John got after 'em. He prosecuted some\nmarsters for beatin' the slaves. He knew they was half feedin' 'em. One\ntime he let us go see where they'd drug two niggers to death with oxen.\nFor stealin' or somethin'. I can't say we were treated bad, 'cause I'd\ntell a story. I've always been treated good by whites, but many of the\nniggers was killed. They'd say bad words to the bosses and they'd shoot\n'em. We'd ask Miss Mary why did they kill old Uncle so and so, and Miss\nMary would say, 'I don't know. It's not right to say when you don't\nknow.' I'm glad to see slavery over.\n\n\n\"When I was turned loose Miss Mary was training me and sister to do\nhandwork, knittin' and such. Mama wouldn't let us dance, didn't want any\nrough children. Miss Mary'd say, when I'd get sleepy, 'Owl eyes, ain't\nyou sleepy?' I'd say, 'No, ma'am, anything you want us to do?' I cried\nto sleep in the big house with Miss Mary and the children, 'cause my\nsister Belle did. Said she's goin' to turn white 'cause she stayed with\nthe white folks, and I wanted to turn white, too.\n\n\n\"Miss Mary'd make our Sunday dresses. My mother put colored thread in\nwoven material and they was pretty. We had plenty of clothes. Miss Mary\nsaw to that. They paid my mother for every child she had that was big\nenough to work, and Marse John saw that others did the same.\n\n\n\"Some whites had a dark hole in the ground, a 'dungeon,' they called it,\nto put their slaves in. They'd carry 'em bread and water once a day.\nI'se afraid of the hole, they'd tell me the devil was in that hole.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _Hagar Lewis_]\n\n\n\n\n\"We set traps for 'possum, coons and squirrels. We used to have big\nsport ridin' goats. One near busted me wide open. Miss Mary's brother\nput me on it, and they punished him good for it. He didn't get to play\nfor a long time. And we had an old buck sheep. He'd keep Oscar and I up\non the oak patch fence all the time.\n\n\n\"We'd watch the doodle bugs build their houses.

A square hole, you know, a\nmachine went in there. A man could crawl in the hole, yes, yes, sho'.\nThe fort was long side the river.

Charlie git better for a while, then he let wood git low\nagain. So he was sol' to Ballard Adams, who had the name of bein' hard\non his slaves. Charlie couldn' do enough wo'k to suit Marster Adams, so\nhe put him in what's knowed as the 'Louisiana shirt.' Dat was a barrel\nwith a hole cut in the bottom jus' big enough for Charlie to slip he\nhead through. Dey pull dis on to him every mornin' and then he couldn'\nsit down or use he arms, coul' jus' walk 'roun' all day, de brunt of\nother slaves' jokes. At night dey took it off and chain him to he bed.\nAfter he have wo'n dis Louisiana shirt a month de marster task he again.\nHe fail and run off to the woods. So Marster Adams, he come to Marster\nMcRay and want to sell Charlie back again, but he couldn', 'cause\nfreedom jus' come and they couldn' sell slaves no more, but Marster\nMcRay say Charlie coul' come back and stay on he place if he wanted to.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _C.B.

Us tek 'em home and clean and dress 'em, and put 'em in de pot\nto have big rabbit supper. I was puttin' some red pepper in de pot to\nseason 'em, and den I rub my eyes wid my han' and git dat pepper in my\neyes and it sho' burn.

Dat goat seem\nlike he kep' on talkin' and sayin' 'Please, God, don' kill me' to de\nlas', but dat ain't done no good. Dat goat jis' beg to de las'.\n\n\n\"My ol' marster he live in a big house. Oh, it was a palace. It had\neight or nine rooms. It was buil' outer logs, and moss and clay was\nstuff' twixt de logs. Dere was boards on de outside and it was all coil'\nnice on de inside.

Ol' marster\nhe kep' good hosses. He warn't mean.\n\n\n\"He had a great big pasture and lots of times people go camp in it. You\nsee it was dis-away, de Yankees dey got rushin' de American people, dat\nde Confed'rates, dey kep' comin' furder and furder wes', 'till dey come\nto Texas and den dey can't go much furder. De Yankees kep' crowdin' 'em\nand dey kep' on comin'. When dey camp in ol' marster' pasture, he give\n'em co'n. I see 'em dribe a whole wagon load of co'n and dump it on de\ngroun' for dey hosses. De Yankees nebber come 'till de war close. Den\ndey come all through dat country. Dat was destruction, it seem to me\nlike. Dey take what dey want.\n\n\n\"When freedom come and de proclamation was read and de ol' marster tol'\n'em dey was free and didn' have no ol' marster no mo' some of de slaves\ncried. He tell 'em, 'I don't want none of you to leave. I'll give you\n$8.00 a mont'.' All de ol' folks stay and help gadder dat crop. It sho'\ngriebe ol' marster and he didn' live long atter dey tek his slaves 'way\nfrom him. Well, it jis' kill' him, dat's all. I 'members de Yankees on\ndat day dey sot to read de proclamation.

Den ol marster git on him. He had t'ree steps, so he could jis'\ngo up dem steps and den his foot be right at de stirrup. My daddy hol'\nde stirrup for him to put he other foot in it.\n\n\n\"I was big 'nuff to run after him and ax him to gimme a dime. He laugh\nand sometime he gimme de dime. Sometime he pitch it to me and I run and\ngrab it up and say, 'T'ankee, marster,' and he laugh and laugh.\n\n\n\"Ol' mistus she had a reg'lar cook.

Eb'ry Sunday one of de other\nwimmins hafter tek de place of de cook so she could git off. All of 'em\nwhat could would git off and go to de chu'ch for de preachin'. Dem what\nturn didn' come one Sunday, would go anudder 'till dey all got 'roun' to\ngo.\n\n\n\"Marster had two or t'ree hundred head of cattle. My gran'father,\nGuilford, had a mule and hoss of he own. Uncle Hank was his brudder, and\nhe had de sheep department to look attar. Sometime de niggers git a hoss\nor a sheep over, den de marster buy 'im. Some of de niggers had a li'l\npatch 'roun' dey cabin' and dey raise veg'table. Ol' marster he buy de\nveg'table sometime. I didn' know what freedom was. I didn' know wedder I\nneeded it or not. Seem to me like it was better den dan now, 'cause I\ngotter look out for myself now.\n\n\n\"Us uster be on de watch-out for ol' marster. De fus' one see him comin'\nlit out and open de gate for him to ride froo and ol' marster toss him a\nnickle.\n\n\n\"When it was time to eat, de ol' cook she holler out, 'T-e-e, t-e-e,\nt-e-e-e' and all us li'l niggers come runnin'.

Sometime\ndey want to go over to anudder plantation on Sunday. Den he give 'em a\npass iffen he willin' for 'em to go. Dey had patterrollers to ride from\nplantation to see iffen dey was any strange niggers dere.\n\n\n\"When dey wanter marry, de man he repo't to ol' marster. He want his\nniggers to marry on his own plantation. He give 'em a nice li'l supper\nand a big dance. Dey had some sort of license but ol' marster tek care\nof dat. He had two sons what had farms and slaves of dere own. Ol'\nmarster didn' care if his slaves marry on his sons' farms. If any of de\nslaves do mean, he mak 'em work on Sunday. He didn' b'leeb in beatin'\n'em.\n\n\n\"So many of 'em as could, usually go to de white folks chu'ch on Sunday\nand hear de white preacher. Dey sit off to deyse'fs in de back of de\nchu'ch.

Dey bury de dead in a ho'made coffin.\n\n\n\"I nebber pay no 'tenshun to talk 'bout ghos'es. I nebber b'leeb in 'em.\nBut one time comin' from chu'ch my uncle' wife say, 'Ike, you eber see a\nghos'? Want to see one?' and I tell her 'I don't give a cent, yes I want\nto see one.' She say, 'I show you a man dress' all in white what ain't\ngot no head, and you gwine feel a warm breeze.' After a while down de\nhill by de graveyard she say, 'Dere he go.' I look' but I neber see\nnuttin', but I feel de warm breeze.\n\n\n\"I uster go to see a gal and I uster hafter pass right by a ol'\ngraveyard. It was all wall' up wid brick but one place dey had steps up\nover de wall so when dey hafter bury a body two men kin walk up dem\nsteps side by side, and dat de way dey tek de corpse over. Well, when I\ngit to dem steps I hear sump'n'. Den I stop and I ain't hear nuttin'.\nWhen I start walkin' ag'in I hear de noise ag'in.

De overseer he had to 'vestigate\n'bout it and if it was so, somebody git a whippin'. Sometimes some folks\nrepo't sump'n' when it warn't true.\n\n\n\"Ol' marster he was plum ind'pendant. His plantation was off from de\ntown. He uster had his mail brung to him. Fur's I kin 'member I didn'\nhad to look out for nuttin'.

Uses little dialect.*\n\n\n\"I was born in Virginia in 1847. My mother was a slave and my\ngrandfather was one of the early settlers in Virginia. He was born in\nJamaica and his master took him to England. When the English came to\nVirginia, they brought us along as servants, but when they got here,\neverybody had slaves, so we was slaves, too. My mother was born in the\nWest Indies.\n\n\n\"A man named Martin brought my grandfather here and we took his name.\nAnd when marster was ready to die, he made a will and it said the\nyoungest child in the slaves must be made free, so that was my father\nand he was made free when he was 16. That left me and my brothers and\nsisters all free, but all the rest of the family was slaves.\n\n\n\"My mother was born a slave near Alexandria. The marster's daughter,\nMiss Liza, read to my mother, so she got some learning. When my mother's\nowner died he left her to Miss Liza, and then my father met my mother\nand told her they should get married. My mother said to Miss Liza: 'I'd\nlike fine to marry Preston Martin.' Miss Liza says, 'You can't do that,\n'cause he's a free nigger and your children would be free. You gotta\nmarry one of the slaves.' Then Miss Liza lines up 10 or 15 of the slave\nmen for my mother to pick from, but mother says she don' like any of\n'em, she wants to marry Preston Martin. Miss Liza argues but my mother\nis just stubborn, so Miss Liza says, 'I'll talk to the marster.' He\nsays, 'I can't lose property like that, and if you can raise $1,200 you\ncan buy yourse'f free.' So my mother and my father saves money and it\ntakes a long time, but one day they goes to the marster and lays down\nthe money, and they gits married. Marster don' like it, but he's\npromised and he can't back out.\n\n\n\"So me and my brothers and sisters is free. And we sees others sol' on\nthe auction block. They're put in stalls like pens for cattle and\nthere's a curtain, sometimes just a sheet in front of them, so the\nbidders can't see the stock too soon. The overseer's standin' just\noutside with a big black snake whip and a pepper box pistol in his hand.\nThen they pulls the curtain up and the bidders crowds 'round. The\noverseer tells the age of the slaves and what they can do. One bidder\ntakes a pair of white gloves they have and rubs his fingers over a man's\nteeth, and he says, 'You say this buck's 20 years old, but there's cups\nworn to his teeth. He's 40 years if he's a day. So they knock that buck\ndown for $1,000, 'cause they calls the men 'bucks' and the women\n'wenches.' Then the overseer makes 'em walk across the platform, he\nmakes 'em hop, he makes 'em trot, he makes 'em jump.\n\n\n\"When I'm old enough, I'm taught to be a saddler and when I'm 17 or 18 I\nenlist in the Confed'rate Army.\n\n\n\"Did they whip the slaves? Well, they jus' about half killed 'em. When\nit was too rough, they slipped into Canada.\n\n\n\"A marriage was a event. The bride and groom had to jump over a broom\nhandle. The boss man had a white preacher, sometimes, and there was\nplenty good beef cornbread. But if the boss didn't care much, he jus'\nlined 'em up and said, 'Mandy, that's your husband and, Rufus, that's\nyour wife.'\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _James Martin_]\n\n\n\n\n\"After the war we were sent to Texas, the 9th U.S. Cavalry, under Capt.\nFrancis F.

Shafter in 1871 and I got my discharge under Gen.\nMerritt in 1872. Then I come to San Antonio.\n\n\n\"I helped bring the first railroad here. The S.P. in them days only ran\nnear Seguin and I was a spiker and worked the whole distance.

I is\nborn on old Buck's place, on December 25th, in 1848. Dat plantation was\nin Franklin Parish, somewhere round Monroe, in Louisiana.\n\n\n\"Me and Bill Adams raised together. When he shoot a deer I run home like\ngreased lightnin' and git de hoss. Sometimes he'd shoot a big hawg and\nI'd skin him.\n\n\n\"When I got big 'nough I'd drive dere carriage. I was what dey calls de\n'waitin' boy.' I sot in dat buggy and wait till dey come out of where\ndey was, and den driv 'em off. I wasn't 'lowed to git out and visit\nround with de other slaves. No, suh, I had to set dere and wait.\n\n\n\"De slaves git out in de fields 'fore sun-up and work till black dark.\nDen dey come home and have to feel dere way in de house, with no light.\nMy mammy and daddy field hands. My grandma was cook, and have to git in\nde cook pot 'bout four o'clock to git breakfas' by daylight. Dey et by\ncandles or pine torches. One de black boys stand behin' 'em and hold it\nwhile dey et.\n\n\n\"De clothes we wore was made out of dyed 'lows.' Dat de stuff dey makes\nsackin' out of. Summer time us go barefoot but winter time come, dey\ngive you shoes with heels on 'em big as biscuits.\n\n\n\"De quarters is back of de big house and didn't have no floors. Dey sot\nplumb on de ground and build like a hawg pen. Dey cut down timber and\nstake it up at de corners and fill it in with timber with de bark on it.\nDere was split log houses and round log houses and all sech like dat.\nDey have only fifty slaves on dat place, and it a big place, big 'nough\nfor a hundred. But what dey do? Dey take de good slaves and sell 'em.\nDat what dey do. Den dey make de ones what am left do all de work. Sell,\nsell, all de time, and never buy nobody. Dat was dem.\n\n\n\"Every Sat'day evenin' us go to de pitcher poke. Dat what dey calls it\nwhen dey issues de rations. You go to de smokehouse and dey weigh out\nsome big, thick rounds of white pork meat and give it to you. De syrup\nweighed out. De meal weighed out. Dey never give us no sugar or coffee.\nYou want coffee, you put de skillet on de fire and put de meal in it and\nparch it till it most black, and put water on it. Mammy make salt water\nbread out of a li'l flour and salt and water.\n\n\n\"Sometimes, dey make de slaves go to church. De white folks sot up fine\nin dere carriage and drive up to de door and git de slaves out of one\ncabin, den git de slaves out of de nex' cabin, and keep it up till dey\ngits dem all. Den all de slaves walks front de carriage till dey gits to\nchurch. De slaves sit outside under de shade trees. If de preacher talk\nreal loud, you can hear him out de window.\n\n\n\"If a cullud man take de notion to preach, he couldn't preach 'bout de\nGospel. Dey didn't 'low him do dat. All he could preach 'bout was obey\nde massa, obey de overseer, obey dis, obey dat. Dey didn't make no\npassel of fuss 'bout prayin' den. Sometimes dey have prayin' meetin' in\na cabin at night. Each one bring de pot and put dere head in it to keep\nde echoes from gittin' back. Den dey pray in de pot. Dat de Gawd's\ntruth!\n\n\n\"Like I done said, massa sol' de good slaves in Monroe. Nobody marry in\ndem days. A gal go out and take de notion for some buck and dey make de\n'greement to live together. Course, if a unhealthy buck take up with a\nportly gal, de white folks sep'rate 'em. If a man a big, stout man, good\nbreed, dey gives him four, five women.\n\n\n\"Sometimes dey run 'way. It ain't done dem no good, for de dawgs am put\non dey trail. If you climb de tree, dem dogs hold you dere till de white\nfolks comes, and den dey let de dogs git you. Sometimes de dogs tore all\ndey clothes off, and dey ain't got nary a rag on 'em when dey git home.\nIf dey run in de stream of water, de dogs gits after 'em and drowns 'em.\nDen Nick, de overseer, he whop 'em. He drive down four stakes for de\nfeets and hands and tie 'em up. Den he whop 'em from head to feets. De\nwhip make out a hide, cut in strips, with holes punch in 'em. When dey\nhits de skin it make blisters.\n\n\n\"All kind of war talk floatin' round 'fore de Yankees come. Some say de\nYankees fight for freedom and some say dey'll kill all de slaves. Seems\nlike it must have been in de middle of de war dat de Yankees come by. We\nhears somebody holler for us to come out one night and seed de place on\nfire. Time we git out dere, de Yankees gone. We fit de fire but we had\nto tote water in buckets, and de fire burn up de gin house full of\ncotton and de cotton house, too, and de corn crib.\n\n\n\"De Yankees allus come through at night and done what dey gwine to do,\nand den wait for more night 'fore dey go 'bout dere business. Only one\ntime dey come in daylight, and some de slaves jine dem and go to war.\n\n\n\"All de talk 'bout freedom git so bad on de plantation de massa make me\nput de men in a big wagon and drive 'em to Winfield. He say in Texas\ndere never be no freedom. I driv 'em fast till night and it take 'bout\ntwo days. But dey come back home, but massa say if he cotch any of 'em\nhe gwine shoot 'em. Dey hang round de woods and dodge round and round\ntill de freedom man come by.\n\n\n\"We went right on workin' after freedom. Old Buck Adams wouldn't let us\ngo. It was way after freedom dat de freedom man come and read de paper,\nand tell us not to work no more 'less us git pay for it. When he gone,\nold Mary Adams, she come out. I 'lect what she say as if I jes' hear her\nsay it. She say, 'Ten years from today I'll have you all back 'gain.'\nDat ten years been over a mighty long time and she ain't git us back yit\nand she dead and gone.\n\n\n\"Dey makes us git right off de place, jes' like you take a old hoss and\nturn it loose. Dat how us was. No money, no nothin'. I git a job workin'\nfor a white man on he farm, but he couldn't pay much. He didn't have\nnothin'. He give me jes' 'nough to git a peck or two of meal and a li'l\nsyrup.\n\n\n\"I allus works in de fields and makes baskets, big old cotton baskets\nand bow baskets make out of white oak. I work down de oak to make de\nsplits and make de bow basket to tote de lunch. Den I make trays and mix\nbowls. I go out and cut down de big poplar and bust off de big block and\nsit down 'straddle, and holler it out big as I wants it, and make de\nbread tray. I make collars for hosses and ox whops and quirts out of\nbeef hide. But I looses my eyesight a couple years back and I can't do\nnothin' no more. My gal takes care of me.\n\n\n\"I come here in 1931. Dat de first time I'm out of Franklin Parish. I\nallus git along some way till I'm blind. My gal am good to me, but de\ndays am passin' and soon I'll be gone, too.\"",

Since her husband's death Susan lives with a son, Willie, west\nof Marshall, Texas, on the Hynson Springs Road.*\n\n\n\"I couldn't tell how old I is, but does you think I'd ever forgit them\nslave days? I 'lieve I's 'bout 87 or more, 'cause I's a good size gal\nspinnin all the thread for the white folks when they lets us loose after\nsurrender.\n\n\n\"I's born right down in Rusk County, not a long way from Henderson, and\nMassa Andrew Watt am my owner. My pappy, Bob Rollins, he come from North\nCarolina and belonged to Dave Blakely and mammy come from Mississippi.\nMammy have eleven of us chillen but four dies when they babies, but\nAlbert, Hob, John, Emma, Anna, Lula and me lives to be growed and\nmarried.\n\n\n\"Massa Watt lived in a big log house what sot on a hill so you could see\nit 'round for miles, and us lived over in the field in little log huts,\nall huddled along together. They have home-made beds nailed to the wall\nand baling sack mattresses, and us call them bunks. Us never had no\nmoney but plenty clothes and grub and wear the same clothes all the year\n'round. Massa Watt made our shoes for winter hisself and he made\nfurniture and saddles and harness and run a grist mill and a whiskey\nstill there on the place. That man had ev'ything.\n\n\n\"The hands was woke with the big bell and when massa pulls that bell\nrope the niggers falls out them bunks like rain fallin'. They was in\nthat field 'fore day and stay till dusk dark. They work slap up till\nSaturday night and then washes their clothes, and sometimes they gits\nthrough and has time for the party and plays ring plays. I 'member part\nthe words to one play and that, 'Rolling river, roll on, the old cow die\nin cold water ... now we's got to drink bad water 'cause old cow die in\ncold water,' but I can't 'member more'n that.

'Bout dusk they calls the chillen and gives 'em a\npiece of corn pone 'bout size my hand and a tin cup milk and puts them\nto bed, but the growed folks et fat pork and greens and beans and sich\nlike and have plenty milk. Ev'ry Sunday massa give 'em some flour and\nbutter and a chicken.

He carry a long whip 'round the neck and I's seed him tie\nniggers to a tree and cowhide 'em till the blood run down onto the\nground. Sometimes the women gits slothful and not able to do their part\nbut they makes 'em do it anyway. They digs a hole, 'bout body deep, and\nmakes them women lie face down in it and beats 'em nearly to death. That\nnigger driver beat the chillen for not keepin' their cotton row up with\nthe lead man. Sometimes he made niggers drag long chains while they\nworks in the field and some of 'em run off, but they oughtn't to have\ndone it, 'cause they chase 'em with hounds and nearly kilt 'em.\n\n\n\"Lots of times Massa Watt give us a pass to go over to George Petro's\nplace or Dick Gregg's place.

Dat jus' plum runs me crazy. De mens use de rope\nwhen dey whups.\n\n\n\"'Bout eatin', we keeps full on what we gits, such as beans, co'nmeal\nand 'lasses. We seldom gits meat. White flour, we don' know what dat\ntaste like. Jus' know what it looks like. We gits 'bout all de milk we\nwants, 'cause dey puts it in de trough and we helps ourselves. Dere was\na trough for de niggers and one for de hawgs.\n\n\n\"Jus' 'bout a month befo' freedom, my sis and nigger Horace runs off.\nDey don' go far, and stays in de dugout. Ev'ry night dey'd sneak in and\ngit 'lasses and milk and what food dey could. My sis had a baby and she\nnuss it ev'ry night when she comes. Dey runs off to keep from gettin' a\nwhuppin'. De marster was mad 'cause dey lets a mule cut hisself wid de\nplow. Sis says de bee stung de mule and he gits unruly and tangle in de\nplow. Marster says, 'Dey can' go far and will come back when dey gits\nhongry.'\n\n\n\"I'se don' know much 'bout de war. De white folks don' talk to us 'bout\nde war and we'uns don' go to preachin' or nothin', so we can't larn\nmuch. When freedom comes, marster says to us niggers, 'All dat wants to\ngo, git now. You has nothin'.' And he turns dem away, nothin' on 'cept\nole rags. 'Twarn't enough to cover dere body. No hat, no shoes, no\nunnerwear.\n\n\n\"My pappy and mos' de niggers goes, but I'se have to stay till my pappy\nfinds a place for me. He tells me dat he'll come for me. I'se have to\nwait over two years. De marster gets worser in de disposition and goes\n'roun' sort of talkin' to hisse'f and den he gits to cussin' ev'rybody.\n\n\n\"In 'bout a year after freedom, Marster Loyed moves from Palo Pinto to\nFort Worth. He says he don' want to live in a country whar de niggers am\nfree. He kills hisse'f 'bout a year after dey moves. After dat, I'se\nsho' glad when pappy comes for me. He had settled at Azle on a rented\nfarm and I'se lives wid him for 'bout ten years. Den I'se goes and stays\nwid my brudder on Ash Creek. De three of us rents land and us runs dat\nfarm.\n\n\n\"I'se git married 'bout four years after I'se goes to Ash Creek, to Bell\nJohnson. We had four chillen. He works for white folks. 'Bout nine years\nafter we married my husban' gits drowned and den I works for white folks\nand cares for my chillen for fo'teen years. Then I'se gits married\nagain. I'se married Fred Miller, a cook, and we lived in Fort Worth. In\n1915 he goes 'way to cook for de road 'struction camp and dats de las'\nI'se hears of dat no 'count nigger!\n\n\n\"Lots of difference when freedom comes. Mos' de time after, I'se have\nwhat I wants to eat. Sometime 'twas a little hard to git, but we gits\non. I'se goes to preachin' and has music and visit wid de folks I'se\nlike. But Marster Loyed makes us work from daylight to dark in de fiel's\nand make cloth at night.\"",

She has forgotten her first master's name,\nbut was sold while very young to Dr. Massie, of Lynchburg, Texas. The\njourney to Texas took three months by ox-cart. After the Civil War\nMintie went to Houston and stayed with an old colored woman whose former\nmaster had given her a house. Later she went to Galveston, where she has\nworked for one family 24 years.*\n\n\n\"I was born in Alabama in 1852, in Tuscaloosa and my mammy's name was\nHannah, but I don't know my pappy's name. When I was still pretty little\nmy brother and uncle and aunt and mother was sold and me with 'em.\n\n\n\"Dr. Massie brung us to Texas in an ox-cart but my sister had to stay\nwith the old mistress and that the last I ever seen my sister. She was\nfour year old then.\n\n\n\"After we reaches Texas we lives on a great big place, somewhere 'round\nLynchburg and Dr. Massie have two girls and I sleeps on the foot of they\nbed. They nice to me, they spoil me, in fac'. I plays with the white\ngals and they feeds me from they tables and in the evenin' my mammy\ntakes me down to de bayou and wash my face and put me on a clean dress.\n\n\n\"My mammy cook for the white folks and they treats us both fine, but one\ngal I knowed was 'bout 8 or 9 and she run away from her master and swim\nde Trinity River and it was winter and her feets freezes.

They done all us that-a-way, sells us like you\nsell a hoss. Then my old master bids me goodby and tries to give me a\ndog, but I 'members what Miss Nancy done say and I sassed him and\nslapped the dog out of his hand.

        "text": "Tom Mills\n\n\n\n\n*Tom Mills was born in Fayette Co., Alabama, in 1858, a slave of George\nPatterson, who owned Tom's father and mother. In 1862 George Patterson\nmoved to Texas, bringing Tom and his mother, but not his father. After\nthey were freed, it was difficult for Tom's mother to earn a living and\nthey had a hard time for several years, until Tom was old enough to go\nto work on a ranch, as a cow-hand. In 1892 Tom undertook stock farming,\nfinally settling in Uvalde in 1919. He now lives in a four-room house he\nbuilt himself. A peach orchard and a grape arbor shade the west side of\nthe house and well-fed cows are in the little pasture. Tom is contented\nand optimistic and says he can \"do a lot of work yet.\"*\n\n\n\"I was born in Alabama, in Fayette Co., in 1858. My mother was named\nEmaline Riley and my father was named Thad Mills. My sisters were named\nElla and Ann and Lou and Maggie and Matildy, and the youngest one was\nEaster. I had two brothers, Richard and Ben. Bob Lebruc was my\ngreat-uncle and for a long while he ran a freight wagon from Salt Lakes\nto this country. That was the only way of getting salt to Texas, this\npart of Texas, I mean, because Salt Lakes is down east of Corpus, close\nto the bay. My uncle was finally killed by the Indians in Frio County.\n\n\n\"In Alabama we lived on Patterson's place. The grandmother of all these\nPattersons was Betsy Patterson and we lived on her estate. My mother\nwove the cloth. It kep' her pretty busy, but she was stout and active.\nMy uncle was blacksmith and made all the plows, too.\n\n\n\"We had a picket house, one room, and two beds built in corners.\n\n\n\"My mother done the cookin' up at the house because she was workin' up\nthere all the time, weavin' cloth, and of course we ate up there. The\nrest of 'em didn't like it much because we ate up there, but her work\nwas there. I guess you never did see a loom? It used to keep me pretty\nbusy fillin' quills. She made this cloth--this four-dollar-a-yard,\nfour-leaf jean cloth, all wool, of course.\n\n\n\"I was too little to work durin' the war; of course we packed a little\nwater and got a little wood. I was goin' to tell you about this scar on\nmy finger. I was holdin' a stick for another little fellow to cut wood\nand he nearly cut my finger off. That sure woke me up.\n\n\n\"They had field work on the place, but a family by the name of Knowles\ndid the farm work. I worked stock nearly all my life. It used to be all\nthe work there was. I think my mother was allowed to make a little money\non this cloth business. That is, cloth she made on the outside. And she\nwas the only one of the slaves that could read. I don't know that they\ncared anything about her readin', but they didn't want her to read it to\nthe rest of 'em. I never earned no money; I was too little.\n\n\n\"We called Old Man Patterson 'master' and we called Mrs. Patterson\n'mistuss'.\n\n\n\"I don't know what the other slaves had to eat--they cooked for\nthemselves, but we had jes' what the Pattersons had to eat. On Sunday\nmornin' we had flour bread. Always glad to see Sunday mornin' come. We\nmade the co'n meal right on the place on these old hand mills that you\nturn with both hands like this. When the co'n jes' fust began to get\nha'd, they would grate that; but when it got ha'd, they would grind it.\nWe always had meat the year 'round. We called hogshead cheese 'souse'.\nBut we never did make sausage then. It was a long time before we had a\nsausage mill. Oh, sho' we made 'chittlin's' (chitterlings). We make them\neven now. Why mama always takes the paunch and fixes it up ever' time we\nkill hogs. We dried beef, strung it out, and put it on the line. When we\ngot ready to cook it, we'd take it and beat it and make hash and fry it\nor boil it. We had lots of deer and turkeys, quail and 'possums, but\nthey never did do much eatin' rabbits. I didn't eat no 'possums and I\ndidn't eat no honey; there was sever'l things I didn't like. I like\nstraight beef, turkeys, quail and squirrel is mighty fine eatin'. I set\ntraps and would ketch quail. Armadillos are pretty good meat, but we\ndidn't eat 'em then. Why, I was grown before I ever saw an armadillo. I\ndon't know where they immigrated from. Yes'm, I think they come from\nMexico; they must surely have because they wasn't any here when I was a\nyoung boy. We used to see 'em in shows before they ever got to be around\nhere.\n\n\n\"I wore a shirt that hit me down about my knees. When my mother made my\npants, she made 'em all in one piece, sleeves 'n all. The fust shoes I\never had, my uncle tanned the leather and made 'em. I guess I was about\nsix years old. He made the pegs, tanned the leather, and made the shoes.\nIt taken 18 months to tan the leather. Bark tanned. Huh, I c'n smell\nthat old tannin' vat now. People nowadays, they're livin' too easy.\n'Fraid to let a drop of water fall on 'em.\n\n\n\"Ever' day was Sunday with me then. After we got up any size, they put\nus to work, but we didn't work on Sunday. After I got to be a cowboy, of\ncourse, they didn't have no Sunday then.\n\n\n\"I was twenty-two when I fust married. It was in Medina County. Her name\nwas Ada Coston. She had on a white dress, draggin' the groun' in the\nback, what you used to call these trains. I remember when they wore\nthese hoops, too. We married about 7 o'clock in the evenin'. I had on\none of these frock-tail coats, black broadcloth suit. I had on good\nshop-made shoes. We had better shoes then than we ever have now. We had\na supper and then danced. Had a big weddin' cake--great big white one,\nhad a hole in the center, all iced all over. I think my auntie made that\ncake, or my cousin. We had coffee, but I never did drink whiskey in my\nlife. I think they had chickens--if I remember right, chicken and\ndressin'. Had a whole lot better to eat then than I can get now. We\ndanced all night. I was at a weddin' where they danced three days and\nnights, and I tell you where it was. Have you been down to Old Bill\nThomas'? You have? Well, that was where it took place. Bill and Ellen\nmarried when I was about twelve years old, and I think they danced three\ndays and nights, and maybe longer. Now, if they didn't tell you that, I\ncould'a told you if I had been there. We danced these old square dances,\nwhat you call the Virginia Reel, and the round dances like the\nSchottische, Polka, waltzes, and all them. I was a dancin' fool, wanted\nto dance all the time. I inherited that from my mother. She was a\nterrible dancer.\n\n\n\"Old Man George Patterson was a very tall and a dark complected man. He\nwas a kind old man. He was good to my mother and all those that come\nfrom Alabama. The old mistuss would whip me, but he didn't. The\ngrandchillun and I could fight all over the house; he would jes' get out\nof the way. But she would get on us once in awhile. The worst whippin'\nshe ever give me was about some sheep. They had a cane patch down close\nto the sheep pen and I went down there and got me some cane and stripped\nit off and I was runnin' 'round down there whippin' the sheep with that\nstalk of cane and she found me down there and took me to the house and\nlearned me better. They never did whip my mother. I know they whipped\ntwo others. Two was all I ever knew of 'em whippin'. Dillard, he married\nthe oldest Patterson girl, and my uncle, he borrowed an auger from Mr.\nDillard to make a frame. When dinner time came, he laid it down and went\nto his dinner. When he got back, this bit was broken and he went and\ntells him (Dillard) and they came down to make a search about who had\nused it. They found that another colored man got it and used it to bore\nsome holes with and broke it, so he took it back and laid it down and\nnever said nothin'. Them days, a thing like that steel bit was awful\nhigh. They laid 'im over a log and whipped 'im and whipped his wife for\nnot tellin' it when they asked her. They had a boy countin' the licks,\nbut I don't know how many he got. They had me down there too, and I was\nready to get away from there. I think they had us down there to show\nwhat we would get if we didn't do right.\n\n\n\"The old lady, the mistuss, she was pretty high-tempered--her head kind\nof bounced, like that--when she got mad. She was slender and tall. I\nthink they lived in a log house; I don't remember much what kind of\nhouse it was. I know my mother weaved cloth in one part of it.\n\n\n\"I don't think the field was very large on that place. I often wanted to\ngo back and see it. It was right on the Sabinal, right opposite Knowlton\nCreek.\n\n\n\"I have heard my mother tell about slaves bein' sold. It was kinda like\na fair they have now. They would go there, and some of 'em sold for a\nthousand dollars. They said somethin' about puttin' 'em on a block; the\nhighest bidder, you know, would buy 'em. I don't know how they got 'em\nthere, for they wasn't much of a way for 'em to go 'cept by oxen, you\nknow. It was back in Alabama where she saw all that. Of course, there\nwas more of that down in Mississippi than Alabama, but she didn't know\nnothin' about that.\n\n\n\"I remember the cotton they raised on the Patterson place. They picked\nthe seeds out with their fingers and made cloth out of it. They would\ntake coarse wool--not merino wool, for that was too fine--and use the\ncoarse wool for a filler. That was what they would make me do, pick the\nseed out of that cotton to keep me out of mischief. I remember that\npretty well. Kep' me tied down, and I would beg the old man to let me\ngo, and when he did, if I got into anything, I was back there pickin'\nseeds pretty quick.\n\n\n\"We would get up about daybreak. They might have got up before I knew\nanything about it, but sometimes I got up with my mother.\n\n\n\"What little school I went to was German, at D'Hanis and Castroville. I\nwent to the priest at D'Hanis and to the sisters at Castroville. No\neducation to amount to anything. That was after we were freed. I went to\nschool at the same time that Johnny Ney and his sister, Mary, went to\nschool. I would like to see Johnny and talk to him now. Your grandmother\nand her sisters and brothers went to that school and I remember all of\n'em well. One of them boys, George, was killed and scalped by the\nIndians, and that was caused by them boys playin' and scarin' each other\nall the time. He was with them Rothe boys, and they always had an Indian\nscare up someway to have fun with each other, especially to scare\nGeorge. So when they did discover the Indians and hollered to George, he\nwouldn't run, because they had fooled 'im so much. So the Indians\nslipped up on him and killed 'im.\n\n\n\"Yes, I knew all the Millers better than I did nearly any of the rest of\nthe old settlers up there. Aunt Dorcas, that was George's mother, she\nnursed me through the measles. I was awful sick, and when my mother\nheard it and come up after me, she told my mother to leave me there, she\nwould take care of me. I tell you she took good care of me too.\n\n\n\"But that was after freedom. You see, my mother didn't want to come to\nTexas. She laid out nearly two years before they got hold of her and got\nher to come to Texas. Alabama wasn't thickly settled then. There was\nbottoms of trees and wild fruit she could eat. She stayed out by\nherself, and would come and get something to eat and leave again. But\nPatterson told her if she would come to Texas she would be treated right\nand not be whipped or nothin' like that. And so far as I know, she never\nwas whipped. He kep' his word with her. She was useful and they needed\nher. She wove the cloth and was such a good worker.\n\n\n\"The first cow we ever owned, we cut cockleburrs out of a field of about\nseven or eight acres. Mr. John Ware gave her a cow to cut the burrs out.\n\n\n\"After the war, my uncle carried my mother and his wife and chillen\naway, and when they started with Margaret--she was his niece and my\ncousin--they overtook 'em and took Margaret back. She was house girl,\nshe didn't do nothin' but work in the house. I don't know whether they\never paid her anything or not. They needed her to wait on the old lady.\n\n\n\"I don't know how that come about when they told 'em they was free. I\ndon't know whether mother read it in the paper or he come and told 'em.\nWe went on, and came right on up the same creek to a place where a man\nhad a ranch by the name of Roney. It was an old abonded (abandoned)\nplace, and we didn't have anything to eat. My uncle got out and rustled\naround to get some bread stuff and got some co'n, but while he was gone\nwas when we suffered for something to eat. We didn't have anything to\nkill wild game with. We would fish a little. When he left he went up in\nthe Davenport settlement, up there about where your grandfather lived.\nWe got milk and careless weeds, but that was all we had, and we were\nawful glad to see the co'n come. And that was my first taste of javelin\n(javelina). It evidently was an old male javelin, for I couldn't eat it.\nI don't think my uncle ever stole anything in his life. I was with him\nall the time and I know he didn't. My mother, she went over to\nDavenports' and my uncle got out and rustled to see where he could get\nsomething to do. So they moved up in the Sabinal Canyon and he got on\nOld Man Joel Fenley's place.\n\n\n\"Old Man 'Parson' Monk, I think, was the first person I ever heard\npreach. That was down here in the Patterson settlement (formerly a\nsettlement six miles south of the present town of Sabinal). The\npreachin' was right there on the place. I joined the church after I was\ngrown, but that was the cullud church, then. My mother she joined the\nwhite church. She joined the Hardshell Baptist. She never did live in\nany colony and the cullud church was too far. They had lots of camp\nmeetin's. I never was at but one camp meetin' that I know of. They would\npreach and shout and have a good time and have plenty to eat. That was\nwhat most of 'em went for. But the churches then seemed to be more\nserious than they are now. They preached the 'altar.' You know, like\nanyone wanted to join the church, they was a mourner, you see, seekin'\nfor religion. And they would sing and pray with 'em till they professed\nthe religion. I had a sister that never went to a meetin' that she\ndidn't get to shoutin' and shout to the end of the sermon. I always\ntried to get out of the way before I joined because if she got to me,\nshe would beat on me and talk to me. We always tried to get to her, if\nshe had her baby in her arms, because she would jes' throw that baby\naway when the Spirit moved her.\n\n\n\"Did you ever know of Monroe Brackins over at Hondo City? Well, I and\nhim was both jes' boys and was with Jess Campbell, Joe Dean and a man\nnamed McLemore. They was white men. We went down on the Frio River, and\nthere was some pens down there on the Johnson place. They was three\nbrothers of them Johnsons. We had a little bunch of cattle, goin' down\nthere. This Jess Campbell and Joe Dean was full of devilment and they\nknew Monroe was awful scarey. When we penned the cattle that evenin' it\nwas late and Monroe noticed a pile of brush at the side of the gate. He\nasked 'em what you reckin that was there, and they told him they was a\nman killed and buried there. That night after dark they was fixin' to\nget supper ready and told Monroe to go get some water down at the river,\nbut he wouldn't do it. Well, I never was afraid of the dark in my life,\nso I had to go get the water. Well, we made a fire and fixed supper and\nthen these men put a rope on Monroe and took him off a little piece and\nwrapped the rope around a tree and never even tied the rope fast. The\nother man, McLemore, he went around the camp and came up on the other\nside. He had an old dried cow hide with the tail still on it. The old\ntail was all bent, crimped up. Here he come from down the creek, from\nwhere they told Monroe that fellow was buried, and right toward Monroe\nwith that hide on. Tail first and in the dark it looked pretty bad, and,\nI tell you, Monroe got to screamin'. I believe he would have died if\nthey hadn't let him loose. I never laughed so much in my life. When he\nwould get scared, he would squeal like a hog. He sure was scarey.\n\n\n\"Sometimes, I know, we would be woke up in the night and they would be\ncookin' chicken and dumplin's, or havin' somethin' like that. I'd like\nfor 'em to come ever' night and wake me up. I don't know where it come\nfrom, but they would always wake the chillen up and let 'em have some of\nit. (This is an early recollection of his childhood during slavery.)\n\n\n\"My mother's daddy, if he was here, he could tell plenty of things. He\ncould remember all about them days, and sing them songs too. I've heard\nhim tell some mighty bad things, and he told somethin' pretty bad on\nhisself. He said they captured some Indian chillen and he was carryin\none and it got to cryin' and he jes' took his saber and held it up by\nits feet and cut its head off. Couldn't stan' to hear it cry. He got\npunished for it, but he said he was a soldier and not supposed to carry\nIndian babies. Usually when Indians captured little fellows like that,\nthey carried 'em off. Like when they carried off Frank Buckilew, a white\nboy. And a cullud boy that got away up close to Utopia. They kep' the\nBuckilew boy a long time, long enough that he got to where he understood\nthe language. It was a long time that the Indians didn't kill a darky,\nthough. But after the war, when they brought these cullud soldiers in\nhere to drive 'em back, that started the war with the cullud people\nthen.\n\n\n\"After freedom, I remember one weddin' the white folks had. That was\nwhen John Kanedy (Kennedy) married Melinda Johnson. He was a man that\nlived there on the river and was there up to the time he died. I wasn't\nat the weddin', but I was at the infair. They were married east of Hondo\nCity. They had the infair then and it was a kind of celebration after\nthe weddin'. Ever'body met there and had a big dance and supper and had\na big time. They danced all night after the supper and then had a big\nbreakfast the next mornin'. I was little, but I remember the supper and\nbreakfast, for I was enjoyin' that myself. They was lots to eat, and\nthey had it too. After freedom, I remember these quiltin's where they\nwould have big dinners. They would have me there, threadin' needles for\n'em. We always had a big time Christmas. They had dances and dinners for\na week. Yes'm, the cullud people did. They would celebrate the holidays\nout. That was all free too, and they all had plenty to eat. They would\nmeet at one place one night and have a dance and supper and, the next\nnight, meet over at another place and have the same thing.\n\n\n\"When I got to workin' for myself, it was cow work. I done horseback\nwork for fifty years. Many a year passed that I never missed a day bein'\nin the saddle. I stayed thirteen years on one ranch. The first place was\nright below Hondo City. His name was Tally Burnett and I was gettin'\n$7.50 a month. Went to work for that and stayed about three or four\nmonths and he raised my wages to what the others was gettin' and that\nwas $12.50. He said I was as good as they were. Then I went to Frio\nCity. I done the same kind of work, but I went with the people that\nnearly raised me, the Rutledges.\n\n\n\"That's where I was give twice in the census. My mother gave me in and\nhe gave me in. That was one time they had one man too many.\n\n\n\"I married when I was with them and I worked for him after that. That\nwas when we would work away down on the Rio Grande, when Demp Fenley and\nLee Langford and Tom Roland and the two Lease boys and one or two more\nwas deliverin' cattle to the Gold Franks' ranch. He wanted 8,000\ntwo-year-old heifers. He had 150,000 acres of land and wanted cattle to\nstock it. Some taken a contract to deliver so many and some taken a\ncontract to deliver so many, so these men I was with went down below\nLaredo and down in there. We wound that up in '85. In '86, I went to\nKerr County and taken a ranch out there on the head of the Guadalupe\nRiver. I stayed there two years and a half, till they sold out. This man\nI was workin' for was from Boston, and he leased the ranch and turned it\nover to me and I done all the hirin' and payin' off and buyin' and\never'thing. When he sold out, I left and went on the Horton ranch about\nthirteen months.\n\n\n\"My first wife died in 1892, but we had been separated about five or six\nyears. I married again in Bandera and quit ranchin' and went to stock\nfarmin' for Albert Miller, then leased a place from Charley Montague two\nyears, then went over into Hondo Canyon and leased a place there in '98.\nWe stayed there till 1906, then came to Uvalde. I leased a place out\nhere, about two hundred acres, four miles from town, and had odd jobs\naround here too. Then, about 1907, we went to Zavala County and stayed\ntill 1919. I leased a place here, then, and finally settled at this\nplace I'm on now and have been here ever since.\n\n\n\"I've got 11 chillen livin'. One boy, Alfred, is in Lousiana and I don't\nknow what he's doin', but he's been married about five times. I have a\nboy workin' in the post office in San Antonio named Mack, and the rest\nof the chillen are here. There's Sarah, Riley, Frank, James, Banetta,\nJohn, Theodore, Tommy, Annie Laurie. They all live here and work at\ndifferent places.\n\n\n\"I know when we used to camp out in the winter time we would have these\nold-time freezes, when ever'thing was covered in ice. We would have a\nbig, fat cow hangin' up and we could slice that meat off and have the\nbest meals. And when we was on the cow hunts we would start out with\nmeal, salt and coffee and carry the beddin' for six or eight men on two\nhorses and carry our rations on another horse. I guess it would scare\npeople now to hear 'em comin' with all them pots and pans and makin' all\nthat racket.\n\n\n\"When we camped and killed a yearlin' the leaf fat and liver was one of\nthe first things we would cook. When they would start in to gather\ncattle to send to Kansas, they would ride out in the herd and pick out a\nfat calf, and they would get the 'fleece' and liver and broil the ribs.\nThe meat that was cut off the ribs was called the fleece. It was a\nterr'ble waste, for many a time, the hams wasn't even cut out of the\nhide, jes' left there. Old Man Alec Rutledge used to say, when they\nwould throw out bread and meat, he would say, 'I'll tell you, Tom, he\nwill have to walk alone sometimes because this willful waste will make\nwoeful wants.' He was talkin' about his brother--they was two of 'em and\nsure 'nough, his brother finally lost all his cattle, quit the business,\nand never had nothin' left. There would be an awful lot of good meat\nwasted, and now we are payin' for it.\n\n\n\"The first fence I ever seen wasn't any larger then this addition here,\nand it was put up out of pickets. The Mexicans used to build lots of\nfences and we got the idea from them, mostly on these old-timey\nstake-and-rider fences. It was an awful pasture when they had eight mile\nof fence. The way they made the field fences was nothin' but brush. I\nremember when I was a little fellow at John Kanady's (Kennedy's), George\nJohnson would come over and stay with his sister, Mrs. Kanady, and he\nwould keep the cattle out of the field. One day, he came there and put\nme on his horse. He had loosened up his girt, and I got out there a\nlittle ways and one of the cows turned back. The horse was a regular old\ncow pony and when that cow turned back, the old horse turned just as\nquick and the saddle slipped and I stayed there.\n\n\n\"Oh, pshaw! they turn so quick you have to be on the lookout. You have\nto watch the horse as well as the cow. Some of them horses get pretty\nsmart. One time they were cuttin' cattle and a fellow brought a cow to\nthe edge of the herd and the cow turned back and when she did, the horse\ncut back too and left him there. When he went from under him, that\nfellow's spurs left a mark clear across the saddle as he went over. It\nwas my saddle he was ridin' and that mark never did leave it, where the\nspurs cut across it.\n\n\n\"We've done some ridin' even after my wife, here, and I were married.\nShe's seen 'em breakin' horses and all that pitchin' and bawlin'. But, I\nnever was no hand to show off. If I kep' my seat, that was all I wanted.\nYou see lots of fellows ridin' just to show off, but I never was for\nanything like that.\n\n\n\"No, I never did go up on the trail. I've helped prepare the herd to\ntake. Usually, there would be one owner takin' his cattle up on the\ntrail. They had no place to hold the cattle, only under herd. Usually,\nthey would start with a thousand or fifteen hundred head, but they\ndidn't put 'em all together till they got away out on the divide. They\nwould have 'em shaped up as they gathered 'em and jes' hold what they\nwanted to send. It didn't take so many men, either, because they all\nunderstood their business.\n\n\n\"I was jes' thinkin' about when Mr. Demp Fenley and Rutledge was here.\nThey had about nine hundred head of cattle. We brought 'em right in\nbelow Pearsall, right about the Shiner ranch, and delivered 'em there.\nBut before we got there at a little creek they called _Pato_, they was\nhardly any place to bed the cattle because they was so much pear[TR:\ncactus]. Mr. Rutledge and I always bedded the cattle down, and then I\nwould go on the last relief, usually about the time to get up, anyway.\nHe used me all the time when they would get ready to go to camp in the\nevenin', and we'd spread 'em out and let 'em graze before beddin' 'em\ndown. Sometimes he would give me a motion to come over there, and I knew\nthat meant an animal to throw. He always got me to do the ropin' if one\nbroke out. Well, we was comin on with those cattle and they was a steer\nthat gave us trouble all the time. As soon as you got away, he would\nwalk out of the herd. Well, we got the cattle all bedded down and they\nwere quiet, but that steer walked out. I was ridin' Mr. Fenley's dun\nhorse, and Mr. Rutledge says to me, 'I tell you what we'll do. We'll\nketch that steer out here and give 'im a good whippin'.' I says, 'We'll\nget into trouble, too.' Well, he was to hold 'im away from the herd and\nI was to rope 'im, but the steer run in front of him and out-run 'im. If\nhe would have run in behind him, I would 'a caught 'im, but that steer\nbeat 'im to the herd and run right into the middle of 'em. And did he\nstampede 'em! Those cattle run right into the camp, and the boys all\nscramblin' into the wagon and gettin' on their horses without their\nboots on. One steer fell and rolled right under the chuck wagon. You\nknow, we run those cattle all night, tryin' to hold 'em. It was a pear\nflat there, and next mornin' that pear was all beat down flat on the\nground. They sure did run, and all because of that foolishness. Mr.\nRutledge got to me and told me not to tell it, and I don't reckin to\nthis day anybody knows what done that.\n\n\n\"I never told you about the panther about to get on to me, did I? Well,\nwe was out on the Rio Grande, about thirty-one or thirty-two miles\nbeyond Carrizo. It was at the _Las islas_ (The Islands) Crossin'. I was\nabout three days behind the outfit when they went out there. That was in\nJuly, and they was a law passed that we had to quit wearin' our guns the\nfirst day of July and hang 'em on the ho'n of our saddle. When I got to\nthe outfit, the boys was gettin' pretty tired herdin'. They had to bring\n'em out about six miles to grass and to this little creek. We would put\n'em in the pen at night and feed 'em hay. We were waitin' there for them\nto deliver some cattle out of Mexico. The Mexican told me they was\nsomethin' out there where they were herdin' sheep that was scarin' the\nsheep out of the pen at night. I had seen some bobcats, but I laid down\nunder one of these huisache trees and went to sleep. I had my pistol on\nand was layin' there and about two o'clock, I woke up. I turned over and\nrested myself on my elbow and looked off there about 12 feet from me and\nthere stood a big old female panther. She was kind of squattin' and\nlookin' right at me. I reached right easy and got my Winchester that was\nlayin' beside me and I shot her right between the eyes. Why, I had one\nof her claws here for a long time. She had some young ones somewhere. I\nimagined, though, she was goin' to jump right on me. It wasn't no good\nfeelin', I know. She was an awful large one.\n\n\n\"Oh, my goodness! I have seen lobos, eight or ten in a bunch. They're\nsure mean. I've seen 'em have cattle rounded up like a bunch of cow\nhands. If you heard a cow or yearlin' beller at night, you could go next\nmornin' and sure find where they had killed her. They would go right\ninto the cow or calf and eat its kidney fat first thing. I tell you, one\nsure did scare me one time. I was out ridin', usually ropin' and\nbrandin' calves, and I came across a den in the ground. I heard\nsomething whinin' down there in that hole. It was a curiosity to me and\nI wanted to get one of those little wolf pups. That was what I thought\nit was. I got down there and reached in there and got one of those\nlittle fellows. They was lovos (lobos). They are usually gray, but he\nwas still black. They are black at first, then they turn gray. He was a\nlittle bit of a fellow. Well, I got him out and the old lovo wolf run\nright at me, snappin' her teeth, and my horse jerked back and came near\ngettin' away. But I hung to my wolf and got to my horse and got on and\nleft there. I didn't have nothin' to kill her with. I was jes' a boy,\nthen. I took that pup and give it to Mrs. Jim Reedes, down on the Hondo,\nand she kep' it till it began eatin' chickens.\n\n\n\"I had a bear scare, too. That was in '87, about fifty years ago. Well,\nIra Wheat was sheriff at Leakey in Edwards County, then. I went down\nthere, and I was ridin' a horse I broke for a sheriff in Kerr County. I\ncame to Leakey to see Wheat--you see they was burnin' cattle (running\nthe brands) all over that country then. As I was ridin' along, I seen\nsome buzzards and I rode out there. Somethin' had killed a hog and eat\non it. I knowed it was a bear afterwards, but then I went on down to\nLeakey and started back, I got up on the divide, at the head of a little\ncanyon and I seen those buzzards again. I seen two black things and I\njes' thought to myself them buzzards was comin' back and eatin' on that\ndead hog. I rode up and seen that it was two bears and I made a lunge at\n'em and the old bear run off and the little cub ran up a tree. I\nthought, 'I'll ketch you, you little rascal.' So I tied my horse and I\nwent up the tree after the cub and when I was near 'im, he squalled jes'\nlike a child. I tell you, when it squalled that way, here came that old\nbear and begin snuffin' around the tree. My horse was jes' rearin' and\ntryin' to break loose out there. I tell you, when I _did_ get down there\nand get to him, I had to lead him about two hundred yards before I could\never get on him. He sure was scared. Like it was when I was a boy down\non the Hondo one time and I could hear horses comin' and thought it was\nIndians and after awhile, I couldn't hear nothin' but my heart beatin'.\"\n\n\n                                  ----\n\n\nUncle Tom Mills is one of the most contented old darkies surviving the\ngood old days when range was open and a livelihood was the easiest thing\nin the world to get.

He was born in Abbeville Parish,\nLouisiana, a slave of Prosper Broussard. His father was a Spaniard, his\nmother spoke French, and his master was a Creole. La San's patois is\nsuperior to that of the average French Negro. His story has been\ntranslated.*\n\n\n\"The old war? No, I don't remember so much about it, because I was so\nyoung. I was ten years old at the beginning of the war. I was born the\n13th of May, but I do not know of what year, in the Parish of Abbeville,\non M'sieu Prosper's plantation between Abbeville and Crowley. My parents\nwere slaves. My father a Spaniard, who spoke Spanish and French. My\nmother spoke French, the old master too, all Creoles. I, as all the\nother slaves, spoke French.\n\n\n\"During the war all the children had fear. I drove an old ox-cart in\nwhich I helped pick up the dead soldiers and buried them. A battle took\nplace about 40 miles from the plantation on a bluff near a large\nditch--not near the bayou, no. We were freed on July 4th. After the war\nI remained with my old master. I worked in the house, cooked in the\nkitchen. Early each morning, I made coffee and served it to my master\nand his family while they were in the bed.\n\n\n\"The old master was mean--made slaves lie on the ground and whipped\nthem. I never saw him whip my father. He often whipped my mother. I'd\nhide to keep from seeing this. I was afraid. Why did he whip them? I do\nnot remember. He did not have a prison, just 'coups de fault'\n(beatings). But not one slave from our plantation tried to escape to the\nnorth that I can remember.\n\n\n\"The slaves lived in little cabins. All alike, but good. One or two\nbeds. Rooms small as a kitchen. Chimneys of dirt. Good floors. We had\nplenty to eat. Cornbread and grits, beef, 'chahintes'(coons), des rat\nbois (possum), le couche-couche, and Irish and sweet potatoes.\n\n\n\"Everyone raised cotton. In the evenings the slave women and girls\nseeded the cotton, carded it, made thread of it on the spinning wheel.\nThey made it into cotton for dresses and suits. No shoes or socks. In\nwinter the men might wear them in winter. Never the women or children.\n\n\n\"How many slaves? I do not recall. There were so many the yard was full.\nThey worked from sun-up to sundown, with one hour for dinner. School? I\nhoed cotton and drove the oxen to plow the field.\n\n\n\"I never went to Mass before I was twenty years old. Yes, there were\nchurches and the others went, but I did not want to go. There were\nbenches especially for the slaves. Yes, I was baptized a Catholic in\nAbbeville, when I was big.\n\n\n\"Sunday the Negro slaves had round dances. Formed a circle--the boys and\nthe girls--and changed partners. They sang and danced at the same time.\nRarely on Saturday they had the dances. They sang and whistled in the\nfields.\n\n\n\"The marriages of the slaves were little affairs. Before the witnesses\nthey'd 'sauter le balais'--the two--and they were married. No\ncelebration, but always the little cakes.\n\n\n\"We had no doctor. We used 'vingaire' (an herb) for the fever; la\n'chaspare' (sarsaparilla); la 'pedecha (an herb), sometimes called\nL'absinthe amer, in a drink of whiskey or gin, for the fever. Des\nregulateurs (patent medicines). On nearly all plantations there were\n'traiteurs', (a charm-doctor, always a Negro).\n\n\n\"Noel we had the little cakes and special things to eat, but no\npresents.\n\n\n\n\n[Illustration: _Le San Mire_]\n\n\n\n\n\"I was married by the judge first, and after the marriage was blessed by\nthe priest. I was 21 years old. I wore a new suit, because I had some\nmoney. I worked in the house during the day and at night I caught wild\nhorses and sold them. I remember my wedding day. It was the Saturday\nbefore Mardi Gras. My wife came from Grand Chenier (Cameron) to\nAbbeville when she was small. We had 16 children, 11 boys and five\ngirls. Three girls and two boys died when they were small.\n\n\n\"One year after my marriage I left the big house and made a home of my\nown. For an enclosure I made a levee of earth around. I planted cotton.\nI worked the place for a half or a third.\n\n\n\"I came to Beaumont 12 years ago, so my children could work, because I\nwas sick. I could no longer work.\"",

Charley left the Terrys one year after he was freed. He worked\nin a tobacco factory, then as a waiter, until 1887, when he moved to\nPanola Co. For fifty years he has farmed in the Sabine River bottom,\nabout twenty-five miles southeast of Marshall, Texas.*\n\n\n\"I's born in Virginia, over in Lynchburg, and it was in 1852, and I\n'longed to Parson Terry and Missy Julia. I don't 'member my pappy,\n'cause he's sold when I's a baby, but my mammy was willed to the Terrys\nand allus lived with them till freedom. She worked for them and they\nhired her out there in town for cook and house servant.\n\n\n\"They hired me out most times as nuss for white folks chillen, and I\nnussed Tom Thurman's chillen. He run the bakery there in Lynchburg and\ncome from the north, and when war broke they made him and 'nother\nnorthener take a iron clad oath they wouldn't help the north. Durin' the\nwar I worked in Massa Thurman's bakery, helping make hard tack and\ndoughnuts for the 'federate sojers. He give me plenty to eat and wear\nand treated me as well as I could hope for.\n\n\n\"Course, I didn't git no schoolin'. The white folks allus said niggers\ndon't need no larnin'. Some niggers larnt to write their initials on the\nbarn door with charcoal, then they try to find out who done that, the\nwhite folks, I mean, and say they cut his fingers off iffen they jus'\nfind out who done it.\n\n\n\"Lynchburg was good sized when war come on and Woodruff's nigger tradin'\nyard was 'bout the bigges' thing there. It was all fenced in and had a\nbig stand in middle of where they sold the slaves. They got a big price\nfor 'em and handcuffed and chained 'em together and led 'em off like\nconvicts. That yard was full of Louisiana and Texas slave buyers mos'\nall the time. None of the niggers wanted to be sold to Louisiana, 'cause\nthat's where they beat 'em till the hide was raw, and salted 'em and\nbeat 'em some more.\n\n\n\"Course us slaves of white folks what lived in town wasn't treated like\nthey was on most plantations. Massa Nat and Missy Julia was good to us\nand most the folks we was hired out to was good to us. Lynchburg was\nfull of pattyrollers, jus' like the country, though, and they had a\nfenced in whippin' post there in town and the pattyrollers sho' put it\non a nigger iffen they cotch him without a pass.\n\n\n\"After war broke, Lee, you know General Lee himself, come to Lynchburg\nand had a campground there and it look like 'nother town. The 'federates\nhad a scrimmage with the Yankees 'bout two miles out from Lynchburg, and\nafter surrender General Wilcox and a big company of Yankees come there.\nDe camp was clost to a big college there in Lynchburg and they throwed\nup a big breastworks out the other side the college. I never seed it\ntill after surrender, 'cause us wasn't 'lowed to go out there. Gen.\nShumaker was commander of the 'Federate artillery and kilt the first\nYankee that come to Lynchburg. They drilled the college boys, too, there\nin town. I didn't know till after surrender what they drilled them for,\n'cause the white folks didn't talk the war 'mongst us.\n\n\n\"Bout a year after the Yankees come to Lynchburg they moved the cullud\nfree school out to Lee's Camp and met in one of the barracks and had\nfour white teachers from the north, and that school run sev'ral years\nafter surrender.\n\n\n\"Lots of 'Federate sojers passed through Lynchburg goin' to Petersburg.\nOnce some Yankee sojers come through clost by and there was a scrimmage\n'tween the two armies, but it didn't last long.

We wasn't promised anything. We jus'\nhad to do the best we could. But I heared lots of slaves what lived on\nfarms say they's promised forty acres and a mule but they never did git\nit. We had to go to work for whatever they'd pay us, and we didn't have\nnothing and no place to go when we was turned loose, but down the street\nand road. When I left the Terry's I worked in a tobacco factory for a\ndollar a week and that was big money to me. Mammy worked too and we\nmanaged somehow to live.\n\n\n\"After I married I started farmin', but since I got too old I live round\nwith my chillen. I has two sons and a boy what I raised. One boy lives\nclost to Jacksonville and the other in the Sabine bottom and the boy\nwhat I raised lives at Henderson. I been gittin' $10.00 pension since\nJanuary this year. (1937)\n\n\n\"I never fool round with politics much. I's voted a few times, but most\nthe time I don't. I leaves that for folks what knows politics.

He was sold several times, and is known by the name of\none of his owners, John Range.\n\n\nDuring the Civil War his master, Mr. Jim Herbert, carried him to the war\nas a cook, and when necessary, he was pressed into service, throwing up\nbreast-works; and while he was engaged in this work, at Richmond Va. a\nterrific bombardment of their lines was made, and a part of their\nbreast-works was crushed in, and his master buried beneath it. Frantic\nwith fear for the safety of his master, Frank began to move the dirt\naway; finally he was able to drag him to safety. Though shot and shell\nwere falling all around him, he came out unscathed.\n\n\nFrank Range returned to Newberry at the close of the war, after which he\nmoved to Greenville County in 1901, and into the city in 1935. He is\nnever happier than when, in the center of a group of willing hearers, he\nis reciting in a sing-song tone the different periods of his life.\n\n\nHe attributes his longevity to the fact that he has never tasted\nwhiskey, never chewed tobacco; never had a fight; toothache and\nheadache are unknown to him; the service of a physician has never been\nneeded; he does not know one playing card from another. He can walk five\nor more miles with seeming ease; is jovial and humorous.\n\n\nHe receives a state pension of twenty five dollars annually. His place\nof residence is 101 Hudson St. Greenville, S.C.\n\n\n\n\n  References;\n\n\n  Mr. Guy A.

I know I was 12 years old\nde last year of de war. I belonged to John Hiller in Lexington County,\nnear Columbia, S.C. Old Marse Hiller was strict to his slaves, wasn't\nmean, but often whipped 'em. I thought it was all right then. When de\nYankees come through burning, killing and stealing stock, I was in\nmarse's yard. Dey come up whar de boss was standing, told him dere was\ngoing to be a battle, grabbed him and hit him. Dey burned his house,\nstole de stock, and one Yankee stuck his sword to my breast and said fer\nme to come wid him or he would kill me. O' course I went along. Dey took\nme as fer as Broad River, on t'other side o' Chapin; then turned me\nloose and told me to run fast or they would shoot me. I went fast and\nfound my way back home by watching de sun. Dey told me to not go back to\ndat old man.\n\n\n\"De slaves never learnt to read and write. If any o' dem was caught\ntrying to learn to read or write, dey was whipped bad. I kotched on to\nwhat de white chilluns said, and learnt by myself to say de alphabet.\n\n\n\"We went to de white churches atter de war, and set in de gallery. Den\nde niggers set up a 'brush harbor' church fer demselves. We went to\nschool at de church, and atter school was out in de atternoon, we had\npreaching.\n\n\n\"Befo' freedom come, de patrollers was strong dere, and whipped any\nniggers dey kotched out without a pass; wouldn't let dem go to church\nwithout a pass.\n\n\n\"Lots of hunting round dere, dey hunted rabbits, squirrels, foxes and\n'possums. Dey fished like dey do now.\n\n\n\"De white folks had old brick ovens away from de house, and wide\nfireplaces in de kitchens. Dey cooked many things on Saturdays, to last\nseveral days. Saturday afternoons, we had off to catch up on washing and\nother things we wanted to do.\n\n\n\"I 'member de Ku Klux and de Red Shirts, but don't 'member anything dey\ndid dere.\n\n\n\"We had corn-shuckings and cotton pickings, when de white people would\nhave everybody to come and help. Us niggers would help. Dey had big\nsuppers afterwards.\n\n\n\"We had plenty to eat from de garden of de boss, a big garden dat\nfurnished all de slaves. Den de boss killed hogs and had other things to\neat. Most o' de things raised in de garden, was potatoes, turnips,\ncollards and peas.\n\n\n\"Some of us had witches. One old woman was a witch, and she rode me one\nnight. I couldn't get up one night, had a ketching of my breath and\ncouldn't rise up. She held me down. In dem days, was lots o' fevers with\nde folks. Dey cured 'em and other sickness wid teas from root herbs and\nbarks.\n\n\n\"Abraham Lincoln was a good man. He said you folks ought to let dem\nniggers loose and let dem go to work. He come wid his two men, Grant and\nSherman, and captured de slave bosses. Jeff Davis was one o' de\nforerunners of de war.

He was a good man,\nbut sure made us work. I worked in the fields when I was small, hoed and\npicked cotton, hoed corn. They didn't give us no money for it. All we\ngot was a place to sleep and a little to eat. The big man had a good\ngarden and give us something from it. He raised loads of hogs, to eat\nand to sell. He sold lots of them.

I has a clear\nmind and I allus has had one. My folks did not talk up people's age like\nfolks do dese days. Every place dat I be now, 'specially round dese\ngovernment folks, first thing dat dey wants to know is your name. Well,\ndat is quite natu'al, but de very next question is how old you is. I\ndon't know, why it is, but dey sho do dat. As my folks never talked age,\nit never worried me till jes' here of late. So dey says to me dat last\nweek I give one age to de man, and now I gives another. Soon I see'd dat\nand I had to rest my mind on dat as well as de mind of de government\nfolks. So I settled it at 80 years old. Dat gives me respect from\neverybody dat I sees. Den it is de truth, too, kaise I come along wid\neverybody dat is done gone and died now. De few white folks what I was\ncontemperment (contemporary) wid, 'lows dat I is 80 and dey is dat, too.\n\n\n\"You know dat I does 'member when dat Sherman man went through here wid\ndem awful mens he had. Dey 'lowed dat dey was gwine to Charlotte to git\nback to Columbia. I never is heard of sech befo' or since. We lived at\nold man Jerry Moss's in Yorkville, way back den. Yes sir, everyone said\nYorkville, den, but dey ain't never called Gaffney like dat. Stories\ngoes round 'bout Sherman shooting folks. Some say dat he shot a big rock\noff'n de State House in Columbia. My Ma and my Pa, Henry and Charity\nRice, hid me wid dem when Sherman come along. Us never see'd him, Lawd\nGod no, us never wanted to see him.\n\n\n\"Folks allus crying hard times dese days, ain't no hard times now like\nit was atter Sherman went through Yorkville. My ma and pa give me ash\ncake and 'simmon beer to eat for days atter dat. White folks never had\nno mo', not till a new crop was grow'd. Dat year de seasons was good and\ngardens done well. Till den us nearly starved and we never had no easy\ntime gitting garden seed to plant, neither.\n\n\n\"Yes sir, if I's handy to locust I makes locust beer; den if I's handy\nto 'simmons, why den I makes 'simmon beer. Now it's jes' for to pass de\ntime dat us does dat. But gwine back to de war; den it was for\nnecessity. Dese young'uns now don't know what hard times is. Dey all has\nbread and meat and coffee, no matter how poor dey is. If dey had to live\nfor days and weeks on ash cake and 'simmon beer, as us did den, and work\nand wait on a crop wid nothing but dat in deir bellies; den dey could\ngrumble hard times. I allus tells 'em to shut up when dey starts\nanything like dat around me.\n\n\n\"When dat crop come along, we sho did fall in and save all us could for\nde next year. Every kind of seed and pod dat grow'd we saved and dried\nfor next spring or fall planting. Atter folks is once had deir belly\naching and growling for victuals, dey ain't never gwine to throw no\nrations and things away no mo'. Young folks is powerful wasteful, but if\nsomething come along to break up deir good time like it did to us when\ndat man Sherman held everything up, dey sho will take heed, and dey\nwon't grumble 'bout it neither, cause dey won't have no time to grumble.\n\n\n\"Things passes over quicker sometimes dan we figures out dat dey will.\nEverything, no matter how good it be or how hard, passes over. Dey jes'\ndoes like dat. So dem Yankees went on somewhars, I never know'd whar,\nand everything round Yorkville was powerful relieved. Den de\nConfederate soldiers started coming across Broad River. Befo' dey got\nhome, word had done got round dat our folks had surrendered; but dem\nYankees never fit (fought) us out--dey starved us out. If things had\nbeen equal us would a-been fighting dem till dis day, dat us sho would.\nI can still see dem soldiers of ours coming across Broad River, all\ndirty, filthy, and lousy. Dey was most starved, and so poor and lanky.\nAnd deir hosses was in de same fix. Men and hosses had know'd plenty\ntill dat Sherman come along, but most of dem never know'd plenty no\nmore. De men got over it better dan de hosses. Women folks cared for de\nmen. Dey brewed tea from sage leaves, sassafras root and other herb\nteas. Nobody never had no money to fetch no medicine from de towns wid,\nso dey made liniments and salves from de things dat grow'd around about\nin de woods and gardens.\n\n\n\"I told you 'bout how small I was, but my brother, Jim Rice, went to\nCharleston and helped to make dem breastworks down dar. I has never\nsee'd dem, but dem dat has says dat dey is still standing in good\nconditions. Cose de Yankees tore up all dat dey could when dey got dar.\n\n\n\"Lots of rail fences was made back in dem days. Folks had a 'no fence'\nlaw, dat meant dat everybody fenced in deir fields and let de stock run\nfree. Hogs got wild and turkeys was already wild. Sometimes bulls had to\nbe shot to keep dem from tearing up everything. But folks never fenced\nin no pasture den. Dey put a rail fence all around de fields, and in dem\ndays de fields was never bigger dan ten or fifteen acres. Logs was\nplentiful, and some niggers, called 'rail splitters', never done nothing\nelse but split rails to make fences.\n\n\n\"If I recollects right, Wade Hampton broke down fence laws in dis\ncountry. I sho heard him talk in Yorkville. Dey writ about him in de\nYorkville Inquirer and dey still has dat paper over dar till now. De Red\nShirts come along and got Wade Hampton in. He scared de Yankees and\nCarpetbaggers and all sech folks as dem away from our country. Dey went\nback whar dey come from, I reckon.\n\n\n\"De Ku Klux was de terriblest folks dat ever crossed my path. Who dey\nwas I ain't never know'd, but dey took Alex Leech to Black's Ford on\nBullet Creek and killed him for being a radical. It was three weeks\nbefo' his folks got hold of his body.\n\n\n\"Dr. Bell's calves got out and did not come back for a long time. Mrs.\nBell fear'd dat dey was gitting wild, so she sent de milk girl down on\nde creek to git dem calves. Dat girl had a time, but she found 'em and\ndrove 'em back to de lot. De calves give her a big chase and jumped de\ncreek near a big raft of logs dat had done washed up from freshets. All\nover dem logs she saw possums, musrats and buzzards a-setting around.\nShe took her stick and drove dem all away, wid dem buzzards puking at\nher. When dey had left, she see'd uncle Alex laying up dar half e't up\nby all dem varmints.\n\n\n\"She know'd dat it must be him. When she left, dem buzzards went back to\ndeir perch. First thing dey done was to lap up deir own puke befo' dey\nstarted on uncle Alex again. Yes sir, dat's de way turkey buzzards does.\nDey pukes on folks to keep dem away, and you can't go near kaise it be's\nso nasty; but dem buzzards don't waste nothing. Little young buzzards\nlooks like down till dey gits over three days old. You can go to a\nbuzzard roost and see for yourself, but you sho better stay out'n de way\nof de old buzzard's puke. Dey sets around de little ones and keeps\neverything off by puking.\n\n\n\"Pacolet used to be called Buzzard Roost, kaise in de old days dey had a\nrail outside de bar-room dat de drunks used to hang over and puke in a\ngully. De buzzards would stay in dat gully and lap up dem drunkards'\npuke. One night a old man went in a drunkard's sleep in de bar-room. De\nbar tender shoved him out when he got ready to close, and he rolled up\nagainst dis here rail dat I am telling you about. He 'lowed dat next\nmorning when he woke up, two buzzards was setting on his shirt front\neating up his puke. He said, 'You is too soon', and grabbed one by de\nleg and wrung his head off. But befo' he could git its head wrung off it\nhad done puked his own puke back on him. He said dat was de nastiest\nthing he ever got into, and dat he never drunk no more liquor. Dem days\nis done past and gone, and it ain't nobody hardly knows Pacolet used to\nbe called Buzzard Roost.\n\n\n\"Lawd have mercy, white folks! Here I is done drapped plumb off'n my\nsubject; but a old man's mind will jes' run waa'ry at times. Me and Joe,\nAlex's son, went to see de officer 'bout gitting Joe's pa buried. He\n'lowed dat Alex's body was riddled wid bullets; so we took him and put\nhis bones and a little rotten flesh dat dem buzzards had left, in de box\nwe made, and fetched it to de site and buried him. Nobody ever seed Alex\nbut me, Joe, and dat gal dat went atter dem calves. Us took shovels and\nthrow'd his bones in de box. When we got de top nailed on, we was both\nsick. Now, things like dat don't come to pass. I still thinks of de\nawful days and creeps runs all over me yet.\n\n\n\"All my brothers, sisters, mother and father is done gone.

De hotel was run by\nMaster Lowrance, where de Lorick & Lowrance store is now.\n\n\n\"My daddy, like de general run of Indians, love to hunt but de game not\nbring much cash in. My mammy often give him some change (money) and he\nnot work much but he always good to mammy and she love him and not fuss\nat him, much.

Men went\n'bout town wid deir guns.\n\n\n\"Mammy keep busy cookin', nussin', and washin', and us chillun help. You\nknow I had two brudders older than me and a little baby brudder 'bout a\nyear old, when my mammy rent a small farm from Master Greenfield, down\nat de end of Calhoun Street, near de Broad River. We plant cotton. I was\nthen eleven years old and my brudder was twelve and thirteen. My mammy\nhelp us plant it befo' she go to work at de hotel.\n\n\n\"She was home washin', one day, when my brudders and me was choppin'\ncotton. We chop 'til 'bout eleven o'clock dat mornin' and we say: 'When\nwe gits out de rows to de big oak tree we'll sit down and rest.' We\nchillun lak each other and we joke and work fast 'til we comes to de end\nof de rows and in de shade of de big oak. Then we sets down, dat is, my\noldest brudder and me, 'cause my young brudder was a little behind us in\nhis choppin'. As he near de finish, his hoe hit somethin' hard and it\nring. Ha rake de dirt 'way and keep diggin', light lak.\n\n\n\"What you doin', brudder?' I say. He say: 'Tryin' to find out what dis\nis. It seem to be a pot lid.' Then we jump up and go to him and all of\nus grabble dirt 'way and sho' 'nough it was a pot lid and it was on a\npot. We digs it out, thinkin' it would be a good thing to take home. It\nwas so heavy, it take us all to lift it out.\n\n\n\"It was no sooner out than we takes off de lid and we is sho' s'prised\nat what we see. Big silver dollars lay all over de top. We takes two of\nthem and drops them together and they ring just lak we hear them ring on\nde counters. Then we grabble in de pot for more. De silver went down\n'bout two inches deep. Twenty dollar gold pieces run down 'bout four\ninches or so and de whole bottom was full of big bundles of twenty\ndollar greenbacks.\n\n\n\"We walks up to de house feelin' pretty big and my oldest brudder was\nsingin':\n\n\n    'Hawk and buzzard went to law,\n    Hawk come back wid a broken jaw.'\n\n\n\"Mammy say widout lookin' at us: 'What you all comin' to dinner so soon\nfor?' Then she looked up and see de pot and say: 'Land sakes, what you\nall got?' Then we puts de big pot down in de middle of de floor and\ntakes off de lid, and mammy say: 'Oh! Let's see what we has!' She begin\nto empty de pot and to count de money. She tell us to watch de door and\nsee dat nobody got in, 'cause she not at home!\n\n\n\"She say de money 'mount to $5,700, and she swear us not to say nothin'\n'bout findin' it. She would see what she could find out 'bout it. Weeks\nafter dat, she tell us a big white friend tell her he hear a friend of\nhis buried some money and went to war widout tellin' anybody where it\nwas. Maybe he was killed and dat all we ever hear.\n\n\n\"My mammy kept it and we all work on just de same and she buy these two\nlots on Senate Street. She build de two-story house here at 924, where\nyou sittin' now, and de cottage nex' door. She always had rent money\ncomin' in ever since. By and by she die, after my Indian pappy go 'way\nand never come back. Then all de chillun die, 'ceptin' me.\n\n\n\"I am so happy dat I is able to spend my old days in a sort of ease,\nafter strugglin' most of my young life and gittin' no learnin' at\nschool, dat I sometimes sing my mammy's old song, runnin' somethin' lak\ndis:\n\n\n    'Possum up de simmon tree\n    Sparrow on de ground\n    'Possum throw de 'simmons down\n    Sparrow shake them 'round'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =Project#-1655=\n =Phoebe Faucette=\n =Hampton County=\n\n\n =Approx. 416 words=\n\n\n=MAMIE RILEY=\n\n\n=Ex-Slave=\n\n\n\n\n\"Aunt Mamie's\" hair is entirely white.

However frail he appears, he is able to support himself by\nworking in the yards about the city.\n\n\n\"Well, sir, white folks, I is eighty years old, or leastwise I is so\nclose to it, dat it don't make much difference. But even if I is dat\nold, it don't seem so long since I was a little boy. Years flies by\nmighty fas' to old folks, 'cause deir 'memberance is shorter, while\nyoung folks 'members everything, and in dat way months and years drags\n'long slower to them.\n\n\n\"I was a very small boy when de Civil War was gwine on. It seems like I\nknows all 'bout Sherman's army comin' through dis State, a burnin'\nColumbia and destroyin' and takin' away everything what folks had. I has\nheard so much 'bout slavery and all them times, from my mammy and daddy,\ndat it 'pears to me dat I 'sperienced it all. I 'spects knowin' 'bout\nthings is just 'bout as good and true as seein' them. Don't you?\n\n\n\"My daddy and mammy b'long to Marster Sam Louie, who had a big\nplantation over in Calhoun County. He had 'bout fifty or more grown\nslaves, 'sides many chillun of de slaves. Old marster was a good farmer;\nraised big crops and saved what he made. He sho' was a fine business man\nbut he was mighty hard on everybody he had anything to do wid. He told\nhis slaves to work hard and make him a heap of money and that he would\nkeep it, in case of hard times. Times was all de time hard wid old\nmarster but de niggers never got no money. When news spread 'round dat\nde Yankees was comin' to free de niggers, he called all de slaves up in\nde yard and showed them a big sack of money, what they had made for\nhim, and told them dat he was gwine to kill all of them befo' de Yankees\nset them free and that they wouldn't need no money after they was done\ndead. All de slaves was mighty sad and troubled, all dat day, when old\nmarster made dat speech to them. But somethin' happened. It most makes\nme tremble to talk to you 'bout it now. Providence, or some kind of\nmercy spirit, was sho' walkin' 'round dat plantation dat night. Sometime\nin de night it was whispered 'round amongst de slaves dat old marster\ndone took de smallpoxes and was mighty sick. Mammy said he must have\nbeen terrible sick, 'cause they buried him two days after dat.\n\n\n\"After old marster flew away, everything was different on de plantation.\nMiss Nancy, dat was old marster's wife, told de slaves dat when de\nYankees freed them, they could stay right there and work on shares or by\nthe day, which ever way they wanted. Many stayed on de plantation after\nfreedom while others went away. Me and my folks stayed on wid Miss Nancy\nuntil she die. Then us moved on another plantation in de lower side of\nde county. I stayed dere until my wife died, seventeen years ago.\n\n\n\"Does I 'member anything 'bout how de slaves was treated in slavery\ntime? Well, I 'members a little myself and a heap of what others told\nme. Wid dis I has done told you, I believes I want to stop right dere. A\nlow fence is easier to git over than a high one. Say little and you\nain't gwine to have a heap to 'splain hereafter. Dere is a plenty of\npersons dat has lost deir heads by not lettin' deir tongues rest.\nMarster Sam Louie is dead now. He can't disturb nobody in his grave. He\nhad his faults and done many things wrong but show me dat person what\ndon't mis-step sometimes. All of us, both white and black, is prone to\nstep aside now and then. To tell de truth, old marster never knowed what\nSunday was. Everybody on de plantation worked on dat day as same as any\nother day.\n\n\n\"But Boss, if my old marster was rough and hard and break de Sabbath and\nall dat, he was no worser than what young white folks and niggers is\ndese days. You can see them any time, floppin' 'bout in dese\nautomobiles, a drinkin' and a carryin' on. Sich stuff is abomination in\nde sight of a decent person, much less dat One up yonder. (He pointed\nupward).\n\n\n\"I's gwine to tell you boss, dat slavery time was better for de average\nnigger than what they is gittin' now. Folks say dat slavery was wrong\nand I 'spose it was, but to be poor like a heap of niggers is now, is de\nworse thing dat has ever come upon them, I thinks. Dis gittin' something\nwrong, ain't right. De North had no business sellin' niggers to de South\nand de South had no business buyin' them from de North and makin' slaves\nof them. Everything went on pretty nice for awhile, then de North got\njealous of de South and de South got 'spicious of de North. I believes\ndat if you can't go over and you can't go under, then you should try to\ngo 'round. If de big men up North and here in de South had been good\n'nough and smart 'nough, they might could a gone 'round dat terrible\nCivil War. I believes dat.\n\n\n\"I marry Lucy Nelson when I was 'bout thirty years old. She was a bright\nskin nigger, much brighter than I is. She was high tempered and high\nspirited, too. She was sho' smart, and de best cook I has ever seen.\nJust plain corn bread, dat she cooked in de hot ashes of de fireplace,\ntaste sweeter and better than de cake you buy now. But de least thing\nwould git her temper 'roused. I has knowed her to complain wid de old\nhound dog us had, 'cause he didn't run some rabbits out de woods for me\nto shoot. Fuss wid de cats, 'cause they didn't ketch de mouses in de\nhouse. Quarrel wid de hens, 'cause they eat, cackled, scratched and\nwallowed holes in de yard and wouldn't lay. Told de old rooster many\ntimes dat she was gwine to chop his head off if he didn't crow sooner\nand louder of mornin's and wake me up so I could go to work. All dis\nsounds foolish I knows but you see how bent my back is. Well, I 'spects\nit was bent from totin' so many buckets of water from de spring for her\nto wash wid soon of mornin's, so I could then do a day's work.\n\n\n\"My wife thought she was doin' right by workin' like she did. She\nthought dat she was helpin' me make a livin' for our big family of eight\nchillun. Yes sir, I knows now she was right, but hard work broke her\nhealth and brought her to her bed where she lingered 'bout one year and\nthen she went away from me. All dis took place seventeen years ago and,\nfrom then to dis, I ain't seen no woman I would have for a wife, 'cause\nI ain't gwine to find no woman Lucy's equal. All my chillun are dead,\n'cept two, and I don't know where they is.\n\n\n\"Does poor folks have any blessings and pleasure? Well, yes sir, in a\nway. You see they don't have no worriments over what they has, like rich\nfolks. They can sleep as hot as they want to in de summer time and raise\nas big families as anybody. Sho', poor folks, and especially niggers,\nhas a good time on hog-killin' days. In early summer come them juicy\nbrierberries dat they enjoy so much. They last until watermelon season.\nThen they has 'possum and 'tators in de fall. Most all livin' beings has\ndeir own way of doin' things and deir way of existin'. De hog roots for\nhis, de squirrel climbs for his, de chickens scratches for deirs, and de\nnigger, well, if dere ain't nobody lookin', I reckon they could slip\ndeirs right handy.\n\n\n\"I sho' has enjoyed talkin' to you dis evening and now, if you will\n'scuse me, I's gwine home and cook me a pot of turnips.

Does Alexander sit here\nin the autumn sunshine and while the hours away? Nay, in fact he is\nstill one of the active, working members of the family, ever in the\nfields with his grandchildren, poke around his neck, extracting fleecy\ncotton from the bolls and putting it deftly into the poke.

Well, here I\nis, more than glad to answer, if I can. Where I born? Strange as it\nseems, I born right here in Winnsboro. My name set down in a book:\n'Alexander-boy-mother, Hannah, wench of James Stewart'. Dat de way it\nwas read to me by Dr. Beaty, dat marry a Miss Cherry and live in Rock\nHill. If slavery had never been done 'way wid, dat would be my master\ntoday, 'cause him lak hound dogs and I lak a hound dog. Dat kind of\nbreed got a good nose and make good 'possum dog. Marster Jim tell me one\ntime, dat de first dog sprung from a wolf, and dat fust dog was a hound\ndog. Dat out dat fust dog, (must to a been a bitch, don't you reckon?)\ncome all dogs. I follow his talk wid belief, 'bout de setters, pointers,\nand blood hounds, even to de fices, but it strain dat belief when it git\nto de little useless hairy pup de ladies lead 'round wid a silver collar\nand a shiney chain. Well, you don't care to hear anymore 'bout dat? What\nis de question?\n\n\n\"My master at de fust, was Marster Jim Stewart and my mistress was his\nwife, Mistress Clara. They have two chillun. I 'member Marster Jim and\nMiss Lizzie; they live in a fine house befo' de war, 'round yonder close\nto Mt. Zion College. My mother was de cook and I was de house boy. They\nhad a big plantation 'bout two miles out, sorta southwest of Boro, I\nmean Winnsboro, of course, but de country people still call it Boro.\n\n\n\"On dat plantation was many two-room houses, brick chimneys in de\nmiddle, for de plantation slaves. In de growin' season I go wid marster\nevery day, not to drive, too small for dat, just to hold de hoss, when\nhim git out and then I run errands for him, 'round de house and in de\nfields.\n\n\n\"My mother had another child, Willie Finch. A colored man name of Finch\nis his father but her and de white folks never tell me who my father\nwas. I have to find out dat for myself, after freedom, when I was\nlookin' 'round for a name. From all I hear and 'pear in de lookin'\nglass, I see I was half white for sure, and from de things I hear, I\nconclude I was a Robertson which have never been denied. Maybe it best\njust to give no front names. Though half a nigger, I have tried to live\nup to dat name, never took it in dat court house over yonder, never\ntook it in dat jail or dat calaboose. I's paid my debts dollar for\ndollar and owe no man nothin' but good will.\n\n\n\"What de Yankees do when they come? Let other people tell dat, but seem\nlak they lay de whole town in ashes, 'cept de college and our house\nclose to it, dat they use for de officers while they was in Boro. Why\nthey hear sumpin' bout de Davis name techin' de St. John 'Piscopal\nChurch and they march 'round dere, one cold February Sunday mornin', set\nit afire, and burn it up. Mother and me went to de plantation and stayed\ndere 'til they left.\n\n\n\"When freedom come, I was twelve years old. Mother marry a Finch; Bill\nwas de name of him. Our nex' move was to Dr. Madden's place, just north\nof Boro. Us farm up dere and I do de hoein'. I live dere thirteen years.\nI got to feelin' my oats and tired of workin' for a plum black nigger, I\ndid. Maybe I ought to been more humble but I wasn't.\n\n\n\"I ask myself one night: 'What you gonna do, stay here forever for your\nvittles and clothes?' Then come over my mind I old 'nough for to marry.\nWho I gwine to marry? It pop right in dis head, Sarah was de gal for me.\nI rode old Beck down dere de nex' Sunday; dat was in December. I come\nright to de point wid her and de old folks. They 'low they have no\nobjections if I could take care of her. I say I try to. They say: 'Dat\nain't 'nough, 'range yourself for another year and then come and git\nher'.\n\n\n\"De Lord directs me. I's down here payin' my poll, too. Marster Tom\nShanty Brice come in as us come out. I ask him if he need a hand for\nnex' year. He look me up from top to bottom and say: 'What's your name?'\nI show him my tax receipt. He hire me than and dere. I go right straight\nto Sarah and us tell de old folks. Rev. Gordon marry us de 29th of\nJanuary, 1879. Us has seven chillun. Alex, dat's de one name for me, is\nin Tampa, Florida. Carrie marry a Coleman and is in Charlotte, N.C.\nJimmie is dead. Thomas is in Charleston, S.C. Emma marry a Belton and\nlives wid her husband in Ridgeway, S.C. I stay wid my son, Charley, up\nde country.\n\n\n\"I voted one time in 1876, for Gov. Chamberlain, but when I moved to\nMarster Tom Brice's I thought so much of him, I just quit voting. I\nwould lak to vote one more time to say: 'I have vote one time wid de\nblack part of my nature, dis time I votes wid de white side of my\nnature.' What you laughin' 'bout? If it was de call of dark blood de\nfust time, maybe it's de call of de white blood dis time. You have no\nidea de worry and de pain a mulatto have to carry all his eighty-four\nyears. Forced to 'sociate wid one side, proud to be related to de other\nside. Neither side lak de color of your skin. I jine de Methodist church\nhere in Boro and 'tend often as I can and as I hear my preacher Owens\npreach, dat dere will be no sex in hebben, I hopes and prays dat dere'll\nbe no sich thing as a color line in hebben.\n\n\n\"Who de best white men I ever know?

Sell out and\nmove to Walhalla and us move to pappy on de McNeal place. Dat year us\nall jined de church, Union Church. I now b'longs to New Hope Methodist\nChurch. Us nex' move to Mr. Bill Crawford's place. Mr. Crawford got to\nbe school commissioner on de 'publican ticket and white folks call him\nscalawag. Him have pappy and all de colored folks go to de 'lection box\nand vote. Ku Klux come dere one night and whip every nigger man they\ncould lay deir hands on. Things quiet down then but us no more go to de\n'lection box and vote.\n\n\n\"'Bout dis time thoughts of de gals got in my head and feets at de same\ntime. I was buyin' a biled shirt and celluloid collar, in Mr. Sailing\nWolf's store, one Saturday, and in walked Ceily Johnson. I commence to\ncourt her right then and dere, befo' I ever git inside dat shirt and\ncollar. Her have dark skin and was good to look at, I tell you. I\nde-sash-shay 'bout dat gal, lak a chicken rooster spread his wing 'round\na pretty black pullet, 'til I wear out her indifference and her make me\nhappy by marryin' me. Her was too good lookin' and too bad doin',\nthough, for me. She left by de light of de moon when us was livin' on de\nCummings place, 'bove town. Excuse me now, dat's still a fresh subject\nof torment to me.

Mr. Brice gives the plot of ground,\nfour acres with the house, to Al, rent free. A white man, Mr. W.L.\nHarvey does the ploughing of the patches for him. Al has cataracts on\nhis eyes and can do no work. Since this story was written he has\nreceived his first old age pension check of eight dollars from the\nSocial Welfare Board in Columbia, S.C.\n\n\n\"Does I know what a nonagenarian is? No seh, what dat? Old folks? Well,\ndats a mighty long name and I been here a mighty long time. Glad you say\nit's a honor and a privilege by de mercy of de Lord. I's thankful! You\nwants to know where I was born and who my white folks then?\n\n\n\"I was born just one and a half mile b'low White Oak, S.C., on de old\nMarse Billie Brice place. My pappy b'long to old Miss Jennie Rosboro,\nbut mammy b'long to Marse William Brice. Her name Ann. My old mistress\nname Mary, daughter of de Simontons, on Dumpers Creek.\n\n\n\"You wants de fust thing I 'members, then travel 'long de years 'til I\ncome to settin' right here in dis chair. Well, reckon us git through\ntoday? Take a powerful sight of dat pencil to put it all down.\n\n\n\"Let me see. Fust thing I 'members well, was a big crowd wid picks and\nshovels, a buildin' de railroad track right out de other side of de big\nroad in front of old marster's house. De same railroad dat is dere\ntoday. When de fust engine come through, puffin' and tootin', lak to\nscare 'most everybody to death. People got use to it but de mules and\nbosses of old marster seem lak they never did. A train of cars a movin'\n'long is still de grandest sight to my eyes in de world. Excite me more\nnow than greyhound busses, or airplanes in de sky ever do.\n\n\n\"I nex' 'members my young misses and young marsters. Dere was Marse\nJohn; he was kilt in de war. Marse Jim, dat went to de war, come back,\nmarry, and live right here in Winnsboro. Marse Jim got a grandson dat am\nin de army a sailin' air-ships. Then dere was Marse William; he moved\noff. One of de gals marry a Robertson, I can't 'member her name, tho' I\nhelp her to make mud pies many a day and put them on de chicken coop, in\nde sun, to dry. Her had two dolls; deir names was Dorcas and Priscilla.\nWhen de pies got dry, she'd take them under de big oak tree, fetch out\nde dolls and talk a whole lot of child mother talk 'bout de pies, to de\nDorcas and Priscilla rag dolls. It was big fun for her tho' and I can\nhear her laugh right now lak she did when she mince 'round over them\ndolls and pies. Dere was some poor folks livin' close by and she'd send\nme over to 'vite deir chillun over to play wid her. They was name\nMarshall. Say they come from Virginny and was kin to de highest judge in\nde land. They was poor but they was proud. Mistress felt sorry for them\nbut they wouldn't 'cept any help from her.\n\n\n\"Well, when I git twelve years old, marster give me to his son, Marse\nCalvin, and give Marse Calvin a plantation dat his son, Homer, live on\nnow. I 'member now old marster's overseer comin' to de field; his name\nwas McElduff. Him say: 'Al, Marse William say come to de house'. I goes\ndere on de run. When I git dere, him 'low: 'Calvin, I wants you to take\nAl, I give him to you. Al, you take good care of your young marster'. I\nalways did and if Marse Calvin was livin' he'd tell you de same.\n\n\n\"I forgit to tell you one thing dat happen down dere befo' I left. Dere\nwas a powerful rich family down dere name Cockrell; I forgits de fust\nname. Him brudder tho', was sheriff and live in Winnsboro. Dere was a\nrich Mobley family dat live jinin' him, two miles sunrise side of him.\nOne day de Cockrell cows got out and played thunder wid Mr. Mobley's\ncorn. Mr. Mobley kilt two of de cows. Dat made de Cockrells mad. They\ntoo proud to go to law 'bout it; they just bide deir time. One day Marse\nEd Mobley's mules got out, come gallopin' 'round and stop in de Cockrell\nwheat field. Him take his rifle and kill two of them mules. Dat made Mr.\nMobley mad but him too proud to go to law 'bout it. De Mobley's just\nbide deir time. 'Lection come 'round for sheriff nex' summer. No\nCockrell was 'lected sheriff dat time. You ask Mr. Hugh Wylie 'bout dat\nnex' time him come to de Boro. Him tell you all 'bout it.\n\n\n\"Dat call to my mind another big man, dat live 'bove White Oak then,\nMarse Gregg Cameron. He was powerful rich, wid many slaves. Him lak to\nbar-room and drink. Him come by marster's house one day, fell off his\nhoss and de hoss gallop on up de road. Dat was de fust drunk man I ever\nsee. Marster didn't know what to do; him come into de house and ask\nMistress Mary. Him tell her him didn't want to scandal de chillun. She\nsay: 'What would de good Samaritan do?' Old marster go back, fetch dat\ngroanin', cussin', old man and put him to bed, bathe his head, make Sam,\nde driver, hitch up de buggy, make West go wid him, and take Marse Gregg\nhome. I never see or hear tell of dat white man anymore, 'til one day\nafter freedom when I come down here to Robinson's Circus. Him drop dead\ndat day at de parade, when de steam piano come 'long a tootin'. 'Spect\nde 'citement, steam, and tootin', was too much for him.\n\n\n\"Niggers never learn to read and write. It was 'ginst de law. White\nfolks fear they would write deir passes and git 'way to de free states.\n\n\n\"Us slaves 'tend Concord Church, tho' Marse Calvin jine de Seceders and\n'tend New Hope. Why us go to Concord? 'Cause it too far to walk to New\nHope and not too far to walk to Concord. Us have not 'nough mules for\nall to ride, and then de mules need a rest. I now b'longs to Bethany\nPresbyterian Church at White Oak. Yes sah, I thinks everybody ought to\njine de church for it's de railroad train to git to hebben on.\n\n\n\"Marse Calvin went to de war. Him got shot thru de hand. Yankees come\nand burn up everything him have. Wheeler's men just as bad.\n\n\n\"After freedom I got mannish. Wid not a drop of blood in me but de pure\nAfrican, I sets out to find a mate of de pure breed. 'Bout de onliest\nplace I could find one of dis hatchin', was de Gaillard quarter. I marry\nGabrielle. Live fust years at de Walt Brice McCullough place, then move\nto de Vinson place, then to de preacher Erwin place. Dat was a fine\npreacher, him pastor for Concord. Him lak to swap hosses. When him come\ndown out de pulpit him looks 'round, see a hoss him lak, soon as not him\ngo home to dinner wid de owner of dat hoss. After dinner him say: 'If it\nwasn't de Sabbath, how would you trade dat hoss for my hoss?' More words\npass between them, just supposin' all de time it was Monday. Then Mr.\nErwin ride back dere nex' day and come back wid de hoss him took a fancy\nfor.\n\n\n\"Mr. Erwin move when he git a call to Texas. I moves to de Bob Sinonton\nplace. From dere I goes to de Jim Brice place, now owned by young Marse\nJames Brice. I been dere 32 years. Gabrielle and me generate thirteen\nchillun, full blooded natural born Africans, seven boys and six gals.\nThen Gabrielle die and I marry Julia Jenkins. Us have five chillun, one\nboy and four gals.

He told me, when I was 'bout two years old he and\nmammy Kitty was took from somewhar in dat state to Richmond, wid de\nunderstandin' to sell us as a family, and to give a man name Johnson, de\npreference. He say de trader couldn't find de man Johnson, and sold us\nto my marster, John Rosborough. My pappy name William, my brothers, Tom\nand Willie and my sisters, Mary and Alice.\n\n\n\"My marster was a kind and tender man to slaves. You see a man love\nhosses and animals? Well, dat's de way he love us, though maybe in\nbigger portion, I 'low. Marster John never marry. Set down dere dat he\nwas good enough to buy my old gran' mammy Mary, though she never could\ndo much work.\n\n\n\"Us knowed dat our gran'pappy was a white man back in Verginny, but dat\nwas her secret, dat she kept locked in her breast and carried it wid her\nto de grave. You say I's very light color myself? So I is, so was she,\nso was pappy. Ease your mind, us had none of de white Rosborough in us.\nUs come on one side from de F.F.V's. I's proud of dat, and you can put\ndown dere dat deres no poor white trash blood in dese old veins, too.\n\n\n\"De last part of de war I worked some in de field, but not enough to\nhurt. My Marster was a Presbyterian, b'longed to Aimwell Church. Two or\nthree acres in cemetery dere now, but they done move de church into de\ntown of Ridgeway.\n\n\n\"Money was not worshipped then like it is now. Not much use of it.\nMarster raised all we eat and made all we wear right dere on de place,\n'bout five miles north of Ridgeway.\n\n\n\"I guess Marster John had forty slaves. Us live in two-story log house\nwid plank floor. Marster John die, us 'scend to his brother Robert and\nhis wife Mistress Mary. I played wid her chillun. Logan was one and\nJanie the other. My marster and mistress was good to me. I use to drive\nde mules to de cotton gin. All I had to do was to set on de long beam\nand crack my whip every now and then, and de mules would go 'round and\n'round. Dere was three hundred and seventy-six acres in dat place. I own\npart of it today. I b'longs to Good Hope Church. I sure believes in de\nLord, and dat His mercies is from everlastin' to everlastin' to them dat\nfears Him.\n\n\n\"'Member but little 'bout de war for freedom, 'cept dat some of de\nslaves of marster was sent to de front to use pick and shovel to throw\nup breast works, and things of dat nature. My pappy was de foreman and\nstayed at home, carry on whilst Marster Robert go.\n\n\n\"'Deed I recollects 'bout de Yankees. They come and ask my pappy, de\nforeman, where was de mules and hosses hid out? Pappy say he don't know,\nhe didn't carry them off. They find out a boy dat knowed; make him tell,\nand they went and got de mules and hosses. They took everything and\nleft.\n\n\n\"Doctor Scott was our doctor. Dere was in them days lots of\nrattlesnakes; had to be keerful of them. Then us hear lots and had lots\nof chills and fever. They found de remedy, but they was way off 'bout\nwhat make them come on you. Some 'low it was de miasma dat de devil\nbring 'round you from de swamp and settle 'round your face whilst you\nsleep, and soon as he git you to snore you sniffed it to your liver,\nlights and gall, then dat make bile, and then you was wid de chills a\ncomin' every other day and de fever all de day. Marster Doctor Hayne\ndone find out dat de skeeter bring de fever and de chills, and funny,\nhe 'low dat it is de female skeeter bite dat does de business. You\nbelieve dat? I didn't at first, 'til old Doctor Lindor tell me dat it\nwas no harder to believe than dat all disease come into de world when a\nfemale bite a apple in de garden of Eden.\n\n\n\"I think Mr. Lincoln was raised up by de Lord, just like Moses, to free\na 'culiar people.

        "text": "=BENJAMIN RUSSELL=\n\n\n=_EX-SLAVE 88 YEARS._=\n\n\n\n\n\"I was born fourteen miles north of Chester, S.C. the property of Mrs.\nRebecca Nance. After eighty-eight years, I have a vivid recollection of\nher sympathy and the ideal relations she maintained with her slaves.\n\n\n\"My father was just Baker, my mother just Mary. My father was bought out\nof a drove of slaves from Virginia. I have been told my mother was born\non the Youngblood place. (Youngblood name of my mistress' people in York\nCounty.) My father was a slave of a Mr. Russell and lived two or three\nmiles from the Nance place, where mother lived. He could only visit her\non a written pass. As he was religiously inclined, dutiful and faithful\nas a slave, my mother encouraged the relation that included a slave\nmarriage between my father and mother. My mother in time, had a log\nhouse for herself and children. We had beds made by the plantation's\ncarpenter. As a boy I remember plowing from sun to sun, with an hour's\nintermission for dinner, and feeding the horses.\n\n\n\"Money? Yes, sometimes white folks and visitors would give me coppers,\n3-cent pieces, and once or twice dimes. Used them to buy extra clothing\nfor Sundays and fire crackers and candy, at Christmas. We had good food.\nIn the busy seasons on the farm the mistress saw to it that the slaves\nwere properly fed, the food cooked right and served from the big\nkitchen. We were given plenty of milk and sometimes butter. We were\npermitted to have a fowl-house for chickens, separate from the white\nfolks. We wore warm clothes and stout brogan shoes in winter; went\nbarefooted from April until November and wore cotton clothes in summer.\nThe master and some of the women slaves spun the thread, wove the cloth\nand made the clothes. My mother lived in a two-story farm house. Her\nchildren were: William, Mattie and Thomas. We never had an overseer on\nthe place. Sometimes she'd whip the colored children, but only when it\nwas needed for correction.\n\n\n\"Yes, sir, I went with my young master, William, to Chester Court House,\nand saw slaves put on a block and auctioned off to the highest bidder,\njust like land or mules and cattle. Did we learn to read and write? We\nwere taught to read, but it was against the law to teach a slave to\nwrite. The Legislature passed an act to that effect. A number of cases\nin which slaves could write, the slave would forge a pass and thereby\nget away to free territory. They had a time getting them back. On one\noccasion I run in on my young master, William, teaching my Uncle Reuben\nhow to write. They showed their confusion.\n\n\n\"All slaves were compelled to attend church on Sunday. A gallery around\nthe interior of the church, contained the blacks. They were permitted to\njoin in the singing. Favorite preacher? Well, I guess my favorite\npreacher was Robert Russell. He was allowed sometimes to use the white\nfolks school, which wasn't much in those days, just a little log house\nto hold forth in winter. In summer he got permission to have a brush\narbor of pine tops, where large numbers came. Here they sang Negro\nspirituals. I remember one was called: 'Steal away to Jesus.'\n\n\n\"Runaway slaves? Yes, we had one woman who was contrary enough to run\naway: Addie, she run off in the woods. My mistress hired her out to the\nMcDonald family. She came back and we had to pelt and drive her away.\n\n\n\"How did we get news? Many plantations were strict about this, but the\ngreater the precaution the alerter became the slaves, the wider they\nopened their ears and the more eager they became for outside\ninformation. The sources were: Girls that waited on the tables, the\nladies' maids and the drivers; they would pick up everything they heard\nand pass it on to the other slaves.\n\n\n\"Saturday afternoons? These were given to women to do the family\nwashing, ironing, etc., and the men cut fire wood, or worked in the\ngarden, and special truck crops. Christmas? Christmas was a holiday, but\nthe fourth of July meant very little to the slave people. Dances? There\nwas lots of dancing. It was the pastime of the slave race. The children\nplayed shimmy and other games, imitating the white children, sometimes\nwith the white folks.\n\n\n\"The master and mistress were very particular about the slave girls. For\ninstance, they would be driving along and pass a girl walking with a\nboy. When she came to the house she would be sent for and questioned\nsomething like this: 'Who was that young man?

The explanation: The\ngirl must breed good strong serviceable children.\n\n\n\"No, I never saw a ghost, but there was a general belief among the race\nin ghosts, spirits, haunts and conjuration. Many believe in them yet. I\ncan never forget the fright of the time my young master, William was\ngoing off to the war. The evening before he went, a whippoorwill lighted\non the window sill and uttered the plaintive 'whip-poor-will.' All the\nslaves on the place were frightened and awed and predicted bad luck to\nMaster Will. He took sick in war and died, just wasted away. He was\nbrought back in rags toward the end of the struggle.\n\n\n\"Mistress always gave the slaves a big dinner on New Year's Day and\ntalked to us out of the catechism. She impressed on us after dinner that\ntime, that we were free. Some were sorry, some hurt, but a few were\nsilent and glad. I and many of the others had been well treated. When we\nwere sick she visited us and summoned a doctor the first thing, but the\nremedies those days were castor oil, quinine, turpentine, mustard\nplaster and bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =Project 1885 -1-=\n =District #4=\n =Spartanburg, S.C.=\n =May 29, 1937=\n\n\n=FOLK-LORE: EX-SLAVE=\n\n\n\n\n\"I was born about 1846, 'cause I was in de war and was 19 years old when\nde war was over.

We lived in a log house with but one room. We\nhad good beds to sleep in, and always had plenty to eat. Old Judge\nButler was a good man. I was 10 years old when he died. Before then I\nworked in and around the house, and freedom come I stayed with the\nButler family two years, then went to Dr. Maxwell's.\n\n\n\"In slavery time we had extra patches of ground to work for ourselves\nwhich we sometimes worked on Saturday afternoons as we had dat time off.\nJudge Butler used to give us a little money, too, before freedom come,\nfor our work.

But some would\nfrolic then and wash up for Sunday, or set around. On Sunday we went to\nchurch and talked to neighbors. On Christmas we celebrated by having a\nbig dinner which the master give us. We had three days holiday or\nsometimes a week. We had New Year's Day as a special day for working,\n'cause it was a sign if we worked good dat day, we would work good all\nde year.

They want to have their own way.\n\n\n\"Over in old Edgefield where I was raised we had plenty to eat; plenty\npeas, corn bread, turnips and other things. We hunted wild game, too. I\nwas a slave of Major Pickens Butler. He was a good man and sometimes\ngave us a little money for our work.

I was born near Broad River in de Blair section. I belonged in\nslavery to de Blair family. My mudder and papa was Grace and Samuel\nBlair, and dey belonged to Capt. Blair. When dey was sold, I was put in\nde house wid a good free nigger woman to raise me and to stay 'till de\nwar was over. Den I come to de Blair house, and helped around de house.\nMy sisters could card, spin and weave, and I helped dem wid it. I didn't\nhave but one dress. When it got dirty, I went down to de creek and\nwashed it and put it against de lims to dry, but I had to put it back on\nbefore it got good dry.\n\n\n\"When I got old enough, I worked in de field, hoeing and picking\ncotton.\"\n\n\n\n\n  Source: Emoline Satterwhite (82), Newberry, S.C.\n  Interviewer: G.L.

I felt sorry fer everybody den. Miss Mary\nRice Scaife, his wife, was mean. She died a year atter. Never felt sad\nnor glad den; never felt no ways out of de regular way, den.\n\n\n\"Overseers I recollects was, Mr. Sam Hughes, Mr. Tom Baldwin, and Mr.\nWhitfield Davis. Mr. Baldwin was de best to me. He had a still-house out\nin a field whar liquor was made. I tote it fer him. We made good corn\nliquor. Once a week I brung a gallon to de big house to Marster. Once I\ngot happy off'n it, and when I got dar lots of it was gone. He had me\nwhipped. Dat de last time I ever got happy off'n Marster's jug.\n\n\n\"When I was a shaver I carried water to de rooms and polished shoes fer\nall de white folks in de house. Sot de freshly polished shoes at de door\nof de bed-room. Get a nickle fer dat and dance fer joy over it. Two big\ngals cleaned de rooms up and I helped carry out things and take up ashes\nand fetch wood and build fires early every day. Marster's house had five\nbedrooms and a setting room. De kitchen and dining-room was in de back\nyard. A covered passage kept dem from getting wet when dey went to de\ndining-room. Marster said he had rather get cold going to eat dan to\nhave de food get cold while it was being fetched to him. So he had de\nkitchen and dining-room jined, but most folks had de dining-room in de\nbig house.\n\n\n\"It took a week to take de cotton boat from Chester to Columbia. Six\nslaves handled de flat-boat. Dere was six, as I said, de boatman, two\noarsmen, two steermen and an extra man. De steermen was just behind de\nboatman. Dey steered wid long poles on de way up de river and paddled\ndown de river. De two oarsmen was behind dem. Dey used to pole, too,\ngoing up, and paddling going down. Seventy-five or eighty bales was\ncarried at a time. Dey weighed around three hundred pounds apiece. In\nColumbia, de wharfs was on de Congree banks. Fer de cotton, we got all\nkinds of supplies to carry home. De boat was loaded wid sugar and coffee\ncoming back. On Broad River we passed by Woods Ferry, Fish Dam Ferry,\nHendersons Ferry and Hendersons Island and some others, but dat is all I\nrecollect. We unloaded at our own ferry, called Scaife Ferry.\n\n\n\"I split rails fer fences. On Christmas we had coffee, sugar and biscuit\nfer breakfast.\"\n\n\n\n\n  Source: Alexander Scaife (82), Box 104, Pacolet, S.C.\n  Interviewer: Caldwell Sims, Union, S.C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n =Project #-1655=\n =Phoebe Faucette=\n =Hampton County=\n\n\n =FOLKLORE=\n\n\n=ELIZA SCANTLING EX-SLAVE=\n\n\n=87 Years=\n\n\n\n\n\"If you wants to know about de slavery times,\" said old Aunt Eliza,\n\"you'se sure come to de right person; 'cause I wuz right dere.\" The\nstatement was easy to believe; for old Aunt Eliza's wrinkled face and\nstiff, bent form bore testimony to the fact that she had been here for\nmany a year. As she sat one cold afternoon in December before her fire\nof fat lightwood knots, in her one-room cabin, she quickly went back to\nher childhood days. Her cabin walls and floor were filled with large\ncracks through which the wind came blowing in.\n\n\n\"I gits along pretty good. My chillun lives all around here, and my\ngranddaughter that's a-standin' at the window dere, takes care of me.\nDen de government helps me out. It sure is a blessing, too--to have sech\na good government! And 'Miss Maggie' good to me. She brought me dis\nwood. Brought it in her truck herself. Had a colored man along to handle\nit for her. But I so stiff I sometimes kin hardly move from me waist\ndown. And sometimes in de morning when I wake, it is all I kin do to get\nup an' wash me face. But I got to do it. My granddaughter bring me my\nmeals.\n\n\n\"I is 87 years old. I know 'cause I wuz so high when de war broke out.\nAn' I plowed my January to July de year 'fore peace declare. I remember\ndat. I wuz a good big girl; but jes' a child--not married yet. Yes'm I\nplowed a mule an' a wild un at dat. Sometimes me hands get so cold I\njes' cry. But dey all say I 'wuz a nigger what wuz a nigger!'\n\n\n\"In May peace declare. De first president of de country wuz Lincoln. He\ntook his seat in March. But I work for de white people 'fore dat. On a\nFriday mornin' our Massa, Mr. Richard Davant come an' told us peace\ndeclare. He come an' told us hisself. I wuz in de cornhouse a-shuckin'\ncorn to go to de mill on Saturday. After freedom all de niggers left\n'cept my Mamma. My father brought us back here to Col. Alex Lawton's\nplace at Robertville. He used to belong to Col. Lawton. Many years atter\ndat Col. Lawton moved to Savannah; but when he died dey brought him back\nhere an' buried him at Robertville.\n\n\n\"My young Missus was de daughter of Mr. Sam Maner, my old Massa; so when\nshe marry Mr. Davant I went wid her. Dey had bought a place in Screven,\nGeorgia. Seven year 'fore peace declare we went to Georgia. On a Monday\nmornin' a colored man come along an' tell Miss Anna de Yankees had took\nWaynesboro. We all went to see it. De fire had left de place clean.\nCould pick up a pin behind it. Other than dat I see nothin'. I never see\nno house burn down. I never hear no gun fire. I jes' see de uniform, an'\nsee 'em kill de hog an' sling 'em 'cross de saddle. Den when we come\nback to Robertville, we see de destruction left behind.\n\n\n\"After I git of size I mind de birds off de corn an' rice an' sech like.\nDen I'd take care of de turkeys. An' we'd sweep de yards. Carry de\nleaves off to de stable in a wheelbarrow.\n\n\n\"Both my missus wuz good to me. De last missus I own treat me jes' de\nsame as her own child. I stayed right dere in de house wid her, an' if I\nwuz sick or anything she'd take care of me same as her own chillun. I\nnurse one of her chillun. An' dat child would rather be wid me than wid\nher own mother!\"\n\n\n  Source: Elisa Scantling, Scotia, S.C. age 87 years.\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SLAVE NARRATIVES: A FOLK HISTORY OF SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES FROM INTERVIEWS WITH FORMER SLAVES, VOLUME XIV, SOUTH CAROLINA NARRATIVES, PART 4 ***.",
