    *Interview with James Monroe Abbot,*
    *Cape Girardeau, Missouri.*


"I's born on December 25, 1854. My muthuh wuz Allie Ann Lane. Aftuh
'mancipation I tuk my daddies name Abbot--he wuz Anthony Abbot, an'
belonged to Ole' Joe Abbot, a neighbor. Our Mastuh wuz Joe Lane an' our
Missus wuz Jane Knox Lane. Dey had a girl, Barbara Ellen, an' two boys,
Tom en' Ed. Latuh years dey had more boys but I nevuh knowd dem.


"De white folks house wuz big, wid porches, an flowers all aroun', an
sweet locust trees in de do' yard. Dis wuz up in Perry County, a few
miles fum Seventy Six Landing.


"When Ole Mastuh died, dat wuz de fathuh ob young Mastuh Joe--he war
sick a long time. Dar he lay fum openin' o' spring, 'bout de time flies
cum, 'til wheat-sowin' time in de fall. An' it's de God's trufe, all dat
time he made me stan' side o' his bed--keepin' de flies offen him, I wuz
jes seben year ole but dere I had tuh stan, day en night, night en day.
Co'se I'd sleep sumtimes wen he wuz sleepin'. Sumtimes when I'd doze, my
bresh ud fall on he's face, den he'd take he's stick an' whack me a few
across de haid an' he'd say, 'Now I dare you to cry.' I cried, but he
didden see me do it.


"But at las' he died. Jane came in an' said, 'He's daid. You can go out
to play now James.' She ustah come in to Ole Mastuh an say, 'Why don'
you let him go out tuh play an' let someone else stan' here?' But Ole
Mastuh say, 'No! I want James.' So now I runs outside--I meets ma sister
an I says: 'By God, he's daid.' I didden know I wus cussin', she say 'I
gonna tell Muthuh on you,' but I's so glad to be out, I runs till I meet
Uncle Rube an' I says, 'By God, he's daid,' den I runs an meets ma
Muthuh, an' I tells her 'By God, he's daid.' She jes kinda turned her
back tuh me an' I cud see her shakin'. She war laffin'!


"Aftuh de buryin' was over, Young Joe an' Jane stood dar on de porch an'
dey call de darkies up one at a time. Fust dey calls ma Grampa an' young
Joe says, 'Yo ole Mastuh's daid. Now I's you' Mastuh, an' Miss Jane here
is your Missus. Do you unnerstand dat?' Grampa say 'Yessir' an pass on.
Nex' he call Lucy, den Aunt Hanna. To each one he says de same, 'I's
yore Mastuh and Miss' Jane here is yore New Missus'--sum ob' em says
'Yessir', sum ob' em jes kinda bows dey haid an' pass on. Wen he call
mah Muthuh up an' say de same tuh her--she look at him a minit den she
say, 'I know'd yuh all dese year as Joe an' her as Jane, an' I ain't
gonna start now callin' you Mastuh or Missus. I'll call you Joe an' Jane
like I allus done,' an' she walked away.


"One time 'fore dat she puddin near kill young Joe. She wuh hoeing corn
in de field an he cum ridin'--I spect he war jes tryin' to be smaht but
he tells her to swallow dat tobbaccy she got in huh mouth. She don' pay
him no mind an' he tell her agin. Den she say, 'You chewing tobaccy?
Whyn't yuh swaller dat?' Dat make him mad and he take a double rope en
whack her cross de sholders. Den she grab huh fingers roun' his throat,
an his face wuh all black es my own 'fore dey pulls her offen him. Den
Ole Mastuh try tuh whup her, but he couldn' by hisself, so he sends fo'
three nigger-buyers dat's close by. When one o' em tells muthuh to put
her han's togedder so he tie em, she grab him by de collar an' de seat
o' he's pants an knock's his haid agin a post like a battern' ram. Den
Ole Mastuh say, 'Men, yo' better go on home. I don' want my cullud folks
to git hurt.' He said it like dat.


"My Muthuh wuz big an' strong. She nevuh worked in de house none but dey
warn't nothin' on de place dat she couldn' do. She cud cut down a big
tree en chop off a rail length an' use a wedge an' maul an' make rails
as good as anybody. Pore Muthuh, she shore did have a hard time. Dey
warn't never nuthin' for her but work hard all de time, she neveh came
in fum de fiel' 'til dark, den had to feed wid a lantern.


"George Swan, a neighbor used tuh whup ole Felix with a
cat-o'-nine-tails til we'd hear him holler over at our place.


"I 'member one time de snow wuz a foot deep an I had tuh gathuh corn. I
wuz barefooted an' barehanded. Mah feet hurt so bad an' mah hands got so
stiff I couldn' work mah fingers, but ah had tuh keep on breakin' off de
corn. Dat night mah feet crack open an' nex' mahnin' when I had tuh make
de fires I lef' a track o' blood across de' flo.' Dey shore wuz mean to
us but God Bless you, dey's all daid an' gone an' de Lawd has spared me.


"Wen de war cum, lots o' cullud men went off to fight fo de Government.
Young Mastuh Joe nevuh went but whenever de sojers cum aroun' Mastuh Joe
couldn' nevuh be foun.'


"One time a passel a' sojers cum to de place, dey didden go to de big
house, but dat night dey spread straw fum de straw pile on de flo ob our
cabin--an' slep dar. We slep in de loft. Nex' mornin' dey went to de
barn an' took de bran' new wagon an' de bes' team o' mules an' dey went
to de smoke house an' hep deysefs. Dar wuz one man standin' on de wagon
cuttin' down de hams an' side meat an' de udder packin' it in de wagon.
Jane cum out on de porch an' start raisin' a ruccus 'bout 'em takin' her
meat. De sojer whut wuz cuttin' down de meat pull out he's gun an' say
'Whut dat she say?' Jane run in de house quick--but he got mad de way
she talk an' den' he take _all_ a de meat an' cans o' lard, an a barrel
of molasses. We ain't nevuh seed dat wagon agin an' it wuz bran' new.


"Dey wuz a battle a few mile away an' dey said you couldn' walk on de
groun' wifout steppin on daid men.


"Wen de war wuz over dey didden want us to know 'bout it. Dey want to
keep us es long es dey could. But it cum out in de papers dat de Guvment
men wuz gonna cum round an' see so dey had tuh turn us loose.


"Abe Lincoln wuz de honestest President we evuh had. Ef it warn't fo'
him we'd still be in bondage.


"If you puts two hoss-shoes above youh door--one up an' one down--it'll
shore catch de wiches if dey tries tuh come through.


"One time it wuz in de evenin' I wuz puttin hay in de pen fo de hosses
at night, an I see a big white light a-cummin' up de lane jes a little
above de top o' de fence. It wuz big an' shiny white. I wuzn' rightly
skeered but I stood dere watchin' it. It cum up an followed de' fence to
de road. I watched to see did it go to de graveyard, an' shure nuf it
did. It meant sumpin' but I don' know whut. An den one day, 'bout noon I
seed sumpin. I wuz out side dar an a little dog cum towards me. It wo' a
bright collar, shinin' like, an' pretty. I ain't nevuh seed nuthin' like
it. I goes to it an calls, 'Heah puppy, heah puppy.' It stan dere n'
look at me fir a minit den turn an' jump ovuh dat ten rail fence an' is
lost in de tall weeds. Now you know no natchel puppy could jump ovuh a
ten-rail fence. I goes in an tells Hanna de cook 'bout it an' she say,
'Lawd ha' mercy! dat's a token fo' sumpin. I don' know whut--mebby
somebody gonna die, but it sho' is a token.'"








Betty Abernathy




    *Interview with Betty Abernathy,*
    *Cape Girardeau, Missouri.*


"My muthuh brought me to Cape Girardeau in 1862, an' I was 'bout ten
yeah ol' at dat time. Huh name was Malissa Abernathy an' she tole' me
that 'Ole Massa' John Abernathy was mah daddy. 'Ole Massa' was mean to
his cullud folks and so was 'Ole Missis Willie'.


"We lived up in Perry County. The white folk had a nice big house an'
they was a number of poor little cabins fo' us folks. Ours was one room,
built of logs, an' had a puncheon floor. 'Ole 'Massa' had a number of
slaves but we didden' have no school, 'ner church an' mighty little
merry-makin'. Mos'ly, we went barefooted the yeah 'round.


"My muthuh an' some of the othuh women done the weavin' an' sewin'. I
learned to spin, I could fill broaches and spin as good as any of 'em.
One time 'Ole' Tom Johnson, the 'nigger-buyer' come up frum Little Rock.
He was go'in to buy muthuh an' her family, and take us to Arkansas, but
'bout that time they was so much talk 'bout freein' the slaves, he was
'fraid to.


"Mostly we had right fair eatin's. We didn't go into the big house much,
jes' on cleanin' days an' such like.


"Ole Massa' often hired his cullud folks out to neighbuh farmuh an' he
didden' care how they was treated. One time my two brothers was hired
out an' in the evenin' they came an' tole muthuh they was goin' to run
away 'cause they's treated so mean. She begged 'em not to come there to
hide 'cause they'd find 'em 'shore, an' most likely kill 'em right
before her eyes. They got away an' 'Ole Massa' come to the cabin to
search fo' 'em. When muthuh tole him she didn't know where they was, he
tied a rope 'round huh neck, an' tied the other end to the raftuhs. Then
he beat her to make her tell.


"Aftuh this we was treated so mean that a neighbor helped us escape.
We-all got in a big wagon, 'bout ten or twelve of us, an' druv us to the
Cape, where they's sojers who'd protect us.


"I remembuh when we got there, they put us in a long, low, frame house,
that stood on the cornuh where Mr. Hecht now lives. Here we lived fo' a
long time. Muthuh an' I had no trouble findin' work to do. She hired me
out fo' twenty-five cents a week an' I was so proud to be earnin' money
that I nevuh thought 'bout learnin' to read or write."








Hannah Allen




    *Interview with "Aunt" Hannah Allen,*
    *Fredericktown, Missouri.*


    _God Got A Hold On Her_


One of the oldest ex-slaves encountered in Missouri is "Aunt" Hannah
Allen of Fredericktown, who claims she is 107 years old. According to
Madison County records, Aunt Hannah gave her age as 82 when she made
application for a marriage license in Fredericktown in 1912.


In spite of her extreme age, Aunt Hannah is able to do all of the work
around her house and she frequently walks up town and back, a distance
of several blocks. Her eyesight is very good and even at her advanced
age she does not have to wear glasses. She claims her grandfather was a
white man and she attributes her unusual health to several causes. She
was well treated as a slave during her younger years when she was under
the ownership of a family named Bollinger. She is childless and has been
content to live on the same spot during the last 71 years. Being a
Negro, she naturally does not take life seriously but as she expresses
it "jes' lives it like it comes".


In reviewing the incidents which she was able to recall on the occasion
of the writer's recent visit to her home, she outlined her story as
follows:


"Down in Pocahontas, Arkansas, a man had 400 slaves and de boss would
allow an old colored man to have meetins every Saturday night and of a
Friday night dey would have a class meeting. Several of dem got religion
right out in de field and would kneel down in de cornfield. De boss went
home and told his wife he thought de slaves was losin' their minds
'cause dey was all kneeling down in de field. De boss' daughter also got
religion and went down to de mourners' bench. De colored church finally
made de boss and his whole family get religion. De old white mistress
would sing and pray while she washed dishes, milked de cows, and made
biscuits. So dey called de doctor and he come and said dat God had got a
hold on her.


"One of de darkies had a baby out in de field about eleven o'clock one
morning. De doctor come out there to her. She was sick a long time
'cause she got too hot before de chile was born. After dis happened de
boss got to be a better man. Dis old boss at first would not let the
darkies have any church meetins.


"On Sunday dere at home de colored folks could get all de water dat ran
from de maple trees. De slaves would get through their work for de boss
and den dere would sometimes be three days when dey could work for
themselves. Den dey would get paid for working for others and den buy
clothes. Dey had de finest boots.


"Dey did not want de mistress to tell me when we was free 'cause dere
was only two of us slaves left there. De other slaves already done run
off. I did not want to leave. When I was a slave I learned to do a job
right or do it over. I learned to sew, cook, and spin. We set by de
fireside and picked a shoe full of cotton and den we could go to bed.
But you did a lot before you got dat shoe full of cotton when it was
pressed down. Dis was almost enough to pad a quilt with. De white
children would be getting their lessons den and dey used a pine torch
for a light to see by.


"I was paid nothin' after slavery but just stayed with de boss and dey
gave me things like a calf, clothes, and I got to go to church with dem
and to camp meetings and picnics. Dey would have big basket meetings
with pies, hogs, sheep and de like. Dey did not allow me to go with
other colored girls if dey had no character. We all set down and ate at
de same table with de white folks and tended de sick together. Today if
de parents would make their children do like dey did in slavery, den we
would have a better race. I was better off dan de free people. I think
dat slavery taught me a lot.


"In Fredericktown I worked for my mistress' sister and made $10 a month.
My father told me to always keep myself clean and nice and to comb my
hair. When I lived in Fredericktown de people I worked for always tried
to keep me from going out with de low class. After I washed de supper
dishes, I would have to go upstairs and cut out quilts and I did not
like it but it was good for me.


"My first husband gave $50 for dis lot I am living on. Dat was just at
de end of de war. He hauled de logs and chinked and white-washed dem and
we had two rooms and a hall. It was a good, nice, warm house. He was a
carpenter. About twenty-five years later my husband built him a frame
house here and dug him a well. He had 4 dozen chickens, 15 head of hogs,
2 horses, 2 wagons, and a buggy to go back and forth to de church at
Libertyville, New Tennessee, or Pilot Knob. We lived together fifty
years before he died. He left me dis home, three horses, 3 milk cows and
three hogs.


"We had no children but 'dopted a little boy. He was my husband's
sister's child. De boy's mother took a notion that she wanted to work
out and she was just a young girl so we took de boy at about de age of
three and he was with us about six years. He went to a colored school
den but a white teacher taught him. We adopted a girl too from Marquand.
De girl's father was a colored man and de mother was a white woman. De
woman den married a white man in Marquand and her husband did not want
de child so we took her at about three years old. We did not have her no
time 'til she died. We have helped to raise about a dozen children. But
I have quit doing dat now. I now has my second husband; he always liked
to have children around but we ain't had none of our own.


"When my first husband died, he did not owe fifteen cents. He just would
not go in debt to nobody. He attended de Masonic lodge. After he died I
went to work. I brought wood, washed, ironed, and cooked. I have made as
high as $15 a week and keep. I took care of a man's children after him
and his wife separated. We have had two houses burn down right here. One
of our houses was a little too close to Saline Creek and it was
condemned and we tore it down and built de one we have now, thirteen
years ago. Harry Newberry has a mill and he give us de lumber to build
dis house.


"We have a lot in de colored graveyard. I have no insurance but Mr.
Allen has some kind of insurance, so if he gets hurt traveling he will
get something. We is getting, together, $25 in pensions a month and we
is living pretty well right now. Some months we spend from seven to
eight dollars on food. Almost everything is cash for us. I been going
barefoot about ten years. I come mighty near going barefoot in de winter
time. We been getting a pension about two years and we was on relief for
two or three years before dat. Our biggest debt is a doctor bill of
about $60.


"Some of de colored folks is better off now and some is worser. De young
race says we who was slaves is ten times worse off den dey 'cause we had
bosses and couldn't read or write. But I say de young race is got all
dis to go by and dey ought to be much better off dan dey is. We is
better off in one sense dan de young race 'cause about half of dem don't
know how to raise their children and dey don't know how to do nothing. I
think our folks has just as good a chance now as de white folks but dey
don't get cultivated. Dey say today dat I don't know nothing 'cause I
was a slave and all I learned was what de master learnt me. But I know
enough to keep out of devilment. I think all dis speed shows dat people
ain't got no sense at all."


    *Interview with Aunt Hannah Allen,*
    *aged 107, Fredericktown, Mo.*
    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*


"I's born in 1830 on Castor River 'bout fourteen miles east of
Fredericktown, Mo. My birthday is December 24. Yes, sir, I is 107 years
old dey say and dey got de records up there in de court house to prove
it. De first time I married Adam Wringer in 1866 and was married by
Squire Addison in Fredericktown. In 1912 on August 11 me and de parson
was married in de Methodist church here and dis was de largest one in
Fredericktown. 'Bout six or seven hundred come for de celebration. I
guess I is 'bout de oldest person in Madison County.


"My father come from Perry County. He was named Abernathy. My father's
father was a white man. My white people come from Castor and dey owned
my mother and I was two years old when my mother was sold. De white
people kept two of us and sold mother and three children in New Orleans.
Me and my brother George was kept by de Bollingers. This was in 1832. De
white people kept us in de house and I took care of de babies most of de
time but worked in de field a little bit. Dey had six boys.


"Our house joined on to de house of de white folks. Many times I slept
on de floor in front of de fireplace near de mistress. Dey got hold of a
big buffalo rug and I would sleep on it. De Bollinger boy, Billy
Bollinger, would go to de cabin and sleep with George, my brother. Dey
thought nothing of it. Old man Bollinger sent some colored folks up to
his farm in Sabula and Billy cried to go long with dem. He let Billy go.
I stayed with old Aunt Betsy on Castor River.


"Before de Civil War broke out we were at Sabula and a Mr. Schafer and
Mr. Bollinger started to take de slaves to Texas. Dey got as far as
Rockport, near Hot Springs. A man by de name of John Higdon from
Colorado married Olive Bollinger and he was injured in de arm in de
Battle of Fredericktown. Den John Higdon went to Rockport after he was
shot and had taken de oath of allegiance. Higdon's wife died in Rockport
and she had a child two years old. I took de baby to care for. De wife
was to be buried back home so dey took de body in a wagon with just a
sheet over it towards Little Rock. I was sitting in de wagon holding de
two year old baby. On de way 'bout ten miles out we were captured by
Federal soldiers and took back to Rockport. De body was put in a room
for two weeks and den placed in a vault above de ground and stayed dar
for 'bout eight years before Mr. Higdon took it back home to bury.


"Higdon took me and his child to 'bout eight miles from Hot Springs to a
hotel he had bought. Once he come up to de hotel with two government
horses and put me and de child on a horse and we were on de way to
Little Rock. We rode dat way for 'bout two weeks and was captured again
near Benton. Higdon had on a Union cape. De soldiers asked us all 'bout
de horses, guns, child, etc. De soldiers let him keep his gun 'cause dey
said it wouldn't kill a flea. But dey cut de buttons off de coat, and
took de spurs off of his heels and said he could not go any further. Dey
took me and de baby and made us sit on de ground. De soldiers took
Higdon to de river. It was late in de day. Dey said dey was going to
transfer him back to Missouri and sell de horses. Higdon had papers from
Col. Lowe and Chambers. De soldiers were Masons and after a while dey
all come back just a-laughing and shaking hands.


"We were put on a boat at Little Rock going toward St. Louis. De child
took de small pox from a lady on de boat. When we got on de boat dey
were firing at the wheels of de boat from across de river. I was feeding
de baby and de chamber-maid come out and said, 'I would drown him'. I
said, 'If you do dat you will have to drown me too'. Dey had Higdon
locked up on de boat and he did not get to see de baby for two weeks
when we got to St. Louis. Just as we got to St. Louis, two white ladies
saw de baby who was so sick and dey went out and got some clothes for
it. De doctor come on de boat and vaccinated me. De sores on the baby
were as big as half dollars.


"Den after we got to St. Louis we went to Whitworth's in Ironton,
Missouri. Higdon was on de back porch and a soldier shot at him and took
him to headquarters dat night. Whitworth had some soldiers take us to
Sabula, twenty-five miles away. De soldiers den took Higdon back to
Ironton until de war was over. Higdon married three times.


"John, the baby, was raised by his grandmother and step-mother in St.
Louis. John married the daughter of a county clerk in Luxemburg,
Missouri. And he became county clerk for thirty years in dis county.
John died 'bout two years ago this July.


"I 'member how dey would treat one slave. De master took two boards and
tied one to de feet and another to de hands and tied her back with ropes
and whipped her with a cat-o'-nine-tails till she bled and den took salt
and pepper and put in de gashes. I can 'member when I was in Iron County
de soldiers stole de boss' horse and de boss had to go to Patton to git
it. Once de soldiers made me get up in de smoke house and throw down
some ham. De authorities 'gaged de soldiers for stealing from de people.
I had to carry some stuff out for Sam Hildebrand to eat.


"I've been living here since de Civil War. Dis is de third house that I
built on dis spot. What I think 'bout slavery? Well we is gettin' 'long
purty well now and I believe it's best to not agitate."

    *Interview with W.C. Parson Allen,*
    *aged 78, Fredericktown, Mo.*
    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*


"I's born in Harrison County, in 1859 and was raised in Georgetown,
Scott County. Yes, I was born a slave. My boss was John McWiggin, a
Scotch-Irishman, who raised hogs, sheep, hemp, and darkies. He had 'bout
230 darkies on de place. We lived in log cabins. Dey had slip doors for
de windows. Man, what you talkin' 'bout? We never saw a window glass.
Had 'bout fourteen cabins and dey was placed so dat de old master could
sit on his porch and see every one of dem. My mistress was Alice
McWiggin.


"I was kep' busy shooin' flies off de table with a pea-fowl brush,
watching de chickens, and gettin' de maple sugar from de root of de
trees. We made a pocket at de base of de tree and dipped out de sugar
water with a bucket. Had 'bout 40 or 50 trees along de road. Had all
kinds of berries. We never got no whippin', only a little boxin'. In
church we sat on one side and de whites on de other. De white preacher
always read a special text to de darkies, and it was this, 'Servants,
obey your master.'


"John McWiggin was a son of a Federal. His brother, Keenie, was a
Confederate. When de Confederate army come Keenie took de silver goblets
down to de creek and gave de soldiers water to drink. Den when de other
soldiers come Johnie would help his crowd. De soldiers took Mac's
iron-gray saddle hosses to Lexington, and de boss had to pay $500 to get
de hosses back. He got some of his mules back. De bushwackers and
nightriders were here. But de boss got 'round it this way. He had de
slaves dig trenches 'cross de road and tie grape vines over it. Den have
de darkies go up on de hill and sing corn songs. Den de nightriders come
a-rushing and sometimes dey would get four or five whites in these
raids. It would kill de men and horses too, when dey fell into de
trench. On Saturday night we had a shindig. We would eat chicken and
pound cake and of course whiskey made in Kentucky. De jail was called de
watch-house.


"After de war de government instituted religious trainin' 'mong de
colored people and gave dem white teachers. I was in Lexington, Ky.,
when I learned my letters. Just how dese latter-day children learn to
read without de letters is a mystery to me.


"I's one of de preachers of de church here and am a deacon, too. I
studied at de University of Louisville, where I was a theological
student, and was one of de main orators in de school.


"I've married a lot of 'em, in Poplar Bluff, Kennett, Farmington, and
Fredericktown, and have preached quite a few funerals. Have preached
some brush arbor sermons and stood under a arbor when we was married. I
baptized 42 in Pennsylvania.


"I ain't eligible enough to express 'bout slavery. I ain't sayin'
nothing."

    *Interview with*
    *Charles Gabriel Anderson,*
    *St. Louis, Missouri.*


    _Hale And Hearty At 119_


Charles Gabriel Anderson, 119 years old, lives at 1106 Biddle Street in
St. Louis alone. He is 5 feet, 3 inches in height, has mixed gray hair
and weighs 145 pounds.


He is slightly bent, but does not have to wear glasses, and is able to
go anywhere in the city without assistance. He has a good memory, and
cheerful attitude. Seated in the church of God in Christ, a store front
church, next door to his home, where he attends because of the
convenient location, he tells the writer the following story:


"I was born January 5, 1818 in Huntsville, Alabama de son of Sallie
McCree and George Bryant. My owner's name was Miss Margaret Tony. She
sold me to Edmond Bryant while I was quite young. I sometimes go by de
name of Bryant.


"I was just big enough to carry water and help a bit with farming while
Miss Tony had me, but I jedge I was 'bout 14 years old when Mr. Bryant
got me, 'cause I was old enough to plow and help with de cotton and I
done a man's size work in his field. I was his slave when de war broke
out. I joined de army in 1864. I used to git a pension of $65 a month,
now I only git $56 a month but last month I didn't git no check at all.
I don't know why. Wish I could find out 'cause I needs it bad to live
on. I used to nurse de white folks children when I was a little boy. I
made a better nurse dan most girls, so jest kept on at it till I was old
enough to be a field hand.


"I had a hard time till de war broke out. Soon as I got a chance, I run
off and went to de army. I served two years and six months. I come out
in 1866. 'Course I was in de hospital till '66. I don't know how long I
was in der wounded. But I do know when I got better, I was such a good
nurse de doctors kept me in de government hospital to help nurse dem
other soldiers and dere sure 'nough was a heap of 'em up dere. Dat was
in Madison, Wisconsin. After dey turned me loose from de hospital, I
went to work in a barber shop up dere. I worked in it one year to learn
de trade. After I learned de barber trade I don't remember how much
longer I stayed dere. I left dere and went to Dodgeville, Wisconsin and
opened a barber shop of my own and run it about two or three years. Den
I went to Dubuque, Iowa, and stayed about one year and barbered in a
hotel dere.


"I come to St. Louis in 1876 and started being a roust-about and firing
on boats. I changed from dat after awhile and went to driving private
carriages and done glass cleaning.


"I got what little education I got, 'tending night school here in St.
Louis. I got 'nough to git ordained in de Chamber Street Baptist Church
for a preacher. Den I come in holiness in Elder Jones, Church of God in
Christ on Kennerly Avenue. I pastored the Macedonia Spiritual Church
eight years in East St. Louis, Ill. I been married twice and am de
father of three children, all dead, and both wifes dead. I don't know
how long none of 'em been dead. My mother died while I was in de army
and my father got drowned before I was born. I only had two sisters and
three brothers, and dey is all dead. My brother, Jim Bryant, died in de
army. He enlisted one year before I did, but in a different regiment. I
has voted many times in my life time, and always voted Republican till
dis last election, I decided I better vote de Democrat ticket and I did,
and I don't regret it either.


"I gits my washing done by de neighbors dat do washing and I eat at de
restaurant on de corner. De Ku Klux never bothered me none 'cause I
stayed up north out of dere reach.


"I 'member de old slaves used to sing: 'Amazing Grace How Sweet De
Sound'; 'I want to be a Soldier, Since de Lord has set me Free';
'Fighting for Liberty'; 'Why Should We Start, and Fear to Die'; 'Death
is the Gate to Endless Joy and Yet We Dread to Enter There'; 'The pain,
the groan, the dying strife, rights our approaching souls away'; 'Jesus
can make a dying bed, soft as downy pillows are, whilst on his breast, I
lean my head and breathe our lives out sweetly there'.


"Sister, I just think dis younger generation is gone totally. Dey ain't
taught right in de home, and de teachers can't do a thing with 'em. If
it wasn't for de prayers goin' up to de throne of grace from all us old
saints what's got sense enough to trust in nothin' else but Jesus, de
whole business would be gone plum to rack. Dey ain't even got sense
enough to know dat. De young folks' mind is on worldly goods and worldly
pleasures and dere ain't no good in none of it, just misery and woe, to
all it touches. And still dey don't seem to see, and don't want to see
and nobody got any sense, can't make' em see. God help dis generation is
all dat I can say.


"I figure I lived dis long 'cause in de first place, I obey God, I never
did drink liquor or smoke in my whole life. I never wore glasses but
precious little and dat was when I did what little reading and writing I
knowed how to do; 'cause after my children went to school long enough to
read and write for me I just stopped doing dat little bit. Now dey's all
dead so I just makes marks, and lets it go at dat. I am a member of The
Kennerly Avenue Church of God in Christ."

    *Interview with Mary A. Bell,*
    *St. Louis, Missouri.*
    *(Written by  Grace E. White.)*


    _She Loves Army Men_


The subject of this sketch is Mary A. Bell, 85 years old, living in a
4-room frame cottage at 1321 Argus Street, St. Louis County, Missouri.


Mary Bell has a very light complexion, light brown eyes, mixed gray
hair, very long and straight. She has fine features. She is quite bent,
and shows her years, but is cheerful. She is living in the same yard
with her daughter who is married and lives next door with her family,
Mrs. Virginia Miller and six children. Her story follows:


"I was born in Missouri, May 1, 1852 and owned by an old maid named Miss
Kitty Diggs. I had two sisters and three brothers. One of my brothers
was killed in de Civil War, and one died here in St. Louis in 1919. His
name was Spot. My other brother, four years younger than I, died in
October, 1925 in Colorado Springs.


"Slavery was a mighty hard life. Kitty Diggs hired me out to a
Presbyterian minister when I was seven years old, to take care of three
children.


"I nursed in dat family one year. Den Miss Diggs hired me out to a baker
named Henry Tillman to nurse three children. I nursed there two years.
Neither family was nice to me. De preacher had a big farm. I was only
seven years old so dey put me on a pony at meal time to ride out to de
field and call de hands to dinner. After the meals were finished, I
helped in de kitchen, gathered the eggs, and kept plenty busy. My father
was owned by de Lewis family out in the country, but Miss Diggs owned my
mother and all her children. I never attended school until I came to St.
Louis. When Abraham Lincoln was assassinated I had never been to school.
Dat same year I attended school at Benton Barracks and went about six or
seven months with de soldiers. There was no Negro school in St. Louis at
dat time. The next school I attended was St. Paul Chapel, 11th and Green
Streets. I went dere about six months. De next place I went to school
was 18th and Warren. I went there about two years. My next school was
23rd and Morgan, now Delmar Boulevard, in a store building. I went dere
between two and three years. I was very apt and learned fast. My father
at de time I was going from school to school, was a nurse in Benton
Barracks and my mother taken in washing and ironing. I had to help her
in de home with de laundry.


"I married at de age of twenty-two and was de mother of seven children,
but only have two now living, my daughter dat lives next door and in de
same yard with me, and a son in the Philippine Islands. I have eight
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.


"I so often think of de hard times my parents had in dere slave days,
more than I feel my own hard times, because my father was not allowed to
come to see my mother but two nights a week. Dat was Wednesday and
Saturday. So often he came home all bloody from beatings his old nigger
overseer would give him. My mother would take those bloody clothes off
of him, bathe de sore places and grease them good and wash and iron his
clothes, so he could go back clean.


"But once he came home bloody after a beating he did not deserve and he
run away. He scared my mother most to death because he had run away, and
she done all in her power to persuade him to go back. He said he would
die first, so he hid three days and three nights, under houses and in
the woods, looking for a chance to cross the line but de patrollers were
so hot on his trail he couldn't make it. He could see de riders hunting
him, but dey didn't see him. After three days and three nights he was so
weak and hungry, he came out and gave himself up to a nigger trader dat
he knew, and begged de nigger trader to buy him from his owner, Mr.
Lewis, because Marse Lewis was so mean to him, and de nigger trader knew
how valuable he was to his owner. De nigger trader promised him he would
try to make a deal with his owner for him, because de nigger trader
wanted him. So when dey brought father back to his owner and asked to
buy him, Mr. Lewis said dere wasn't a plantation owner with money enough
to pay him for Spot. Dat was my father's name, so of course that put my
father back in de hands of Marse Lewis. Lewis owned a large tobacco
plantation and my father was de head man on dat plantation. He cured all
de tobacco, as it was brought in from the field, made all the twists and
plugs of tobacco. His owner's son taught him to read, and dat made his
owner so mad, because my father read de emancipation for freedom to de
other slaves, and it made dem so happy, dey could not work well, and dey
got so no one could manage dem, when dey found out dey were to be freed
in such a short time.


"Father told his owner after he found out he wouldn't sell him, dat if
he whipped him again, he would run away again, and keep on running away
until he made de free state land. So de nigger trader begged my father
not to run away from Marse Lewis, because if he did Lewis would be a
ruined man, because he did not have another man who could manage de
workers as father did. So the owner knew freedom was about to be
declared and my father would have de privilege of leaving whether his
owner liked it or not. So Lewis knew my father knew it as well as he
did, so he sat down and talked with my father about the future and
promised my father if he would stay with him and ship his tobacco for
him and look after all of his business on his plantation after freedom
was declared, he would give him a nice house and lot for his family
right on his plantation. And he had such influence over de other slaves
he wanted him to convince de others dat it would be better to stay with
their former owner and work for him for their living dan take a chance
on strangers they did not know and who did not know dem. He pleaded so
hard with my father, dat father told him all right to get rid of him.
But Lewis had been so mean to father, dat down in father's heart he felt
Lewis did not have a spot of good in him. No place for a black man.


"So father stayed just six months after dat promise and taken eleven of
de best slaves on de plantation, and went to Kansas City and all of dem
joined the U.S. Army. Dey enlisted de very night dey got to Kansas City
and de very next morning de Pattie owners were dere on de trail after
dem to take dem back home, but de officers said dey were now enlisted
U.S. Soldiers and not slaves and could not be touched.


"In de county where I was raised de white people went to church in de
morning and de slaves went in de afternoon. I was converted at the age
of fourteen, and married in 1882. My husband died May 27, 1896 and I
have been a widow every since. I do get a pension now, I never started
buying dis little old 4-room frame dwelling until I was sixty-four years
old and paid for it in full in six years and six months.


"I am a member of St. Peter's A.M.E. Church in North St. Louis. I told
you my father's name was Spot, but that was his nickname in slavery. His
full name was Spottwood Rice and my son's full name is William A. Bell.
He is enlisted in de army in de Philippine Islands. I love army men, my
father, brother, husband and son were all army men. I love a man who
will fight for his rights, and any person that wants to be something."








William Black




    *Interview with William Black,*
    *Hannibal, Missouri.*


    _He's Quit Having Birthdays_


William Black of 919 South Arch Street, Hannibal, Missouri, is one of
the few ex-slaves living in Marion County. He is now about eighty-five
years old, and has lived his entire life in Marion, Monroe, and Ralls
Counties. In chatting about his life and experiences he says:


"My mother and father come from Virginia. I don't know how old I is, but
I have had one birthday and the rest is anniversaries. I think I is
about eighty-five. I was born in slavery and when I was eight years old
was bonded out to Sam Briggs of New London. Mr. Briggs was a good master
and I didn't have a whole lot to do. My job was to take his children to
school and go after dem of an evening. In the mean time I just piddled
around in de fields.


"In de evening when de work was done we would sit 'round and play
marbles and sing songs. We made our songs up as we went along. Sometimes
dere would be a corn shuckin' and dat is when we had a good time, but we
always shucked a lot of dat corn.


"I did not go to school any and today I do not even have de sense of
writing at all. Unless some one guides my hand I cannot make a mark. I
wish I wasn't so old now so I could go to school and learn how to read
and write.


"I 'member one day when de master was gone, us darkies thought we would
have a party. I guess de master knowed we was going to have one, 'cause
dat night, when we was all having a good time, my sister said to me,
'Bill, over dere is old master Sam.' He had dressed up to look like us
and see what we was up to. Master Sam didn't do anything to us dat time
'cause he had too good a time hisself.


"At the age of thirteen my sister was bonded out to some man who was
awful mean, she was a bad girl, too. After we were freed she told me all
about her old master. She said, 'One Christmas my master was drunk and I
went to wish him a merry Christmas and get some candy. He hit at me and
I ducked and run 'round de house so fast I burnt de grass 'round dat
house and I know dere ain't no grass growing dere yet.'


"When we was freed our master didn't give us nothing, but some clothes
and five dollars. He told us we could stay if we wanted to, but we was
so glad to be free dat we all left him. He was a good man though.


"Durin' de war we could not leave de master's house to go to de
neighbors without a pass. If we didn't have a pass de paddyrollers would
get us and kill us or take us away.


"After de freedom come we could vote, but some of us never done it. To
dis day I ain't never voted. De government has been as good to us as dey
could. I get ten dollars a month and think I should have more, but I
know dey is giving us all dey can and some day dey will give us
ex-slaves more.


"I am glad dat we have our churches and schools. We don't have no
business being with de good white people. Dey is cultured and we is not,
but some day we will be as good and dey will be glad to have us 'round
dem more. Just 'cause we is black is no sign that we ain't good niggers.


"I don't like de way de younger generation is doin'. As my neighbors
say, 'the devil is gettin' dem and it won't be long 'fore he will come
and get dem all.' When I was young we didn't act like dey do now-a-days.
We didn't get drunk and stay dat way and kill each other. De good Lord
is going to do something to all of dem, mark my word.


"I can't 'member some of the songs we sung, but when we was freed we
sang 'Master's Body is Molding in the Grave', and I know some of dem
is."


William Black lives by himself in a house owned by his daughter. He is
unable to do any kind of manual labor and has not done any kind of work
for about five years. He is active in religious affairs and attends
church regularly. He is one of the few persons living in Marion County
who raises tobacco. His garden plot, five by ten feet, is close to his
house.








George Bollinger




    *Interview with George Bollinger,*
    *Cape Girardeau, Missouri.*


    _He Saw Many "Hants"_


George Bollinger is a typical, old-time Negro who lives in Cape
Girardeau. In his younger days he was big and powerful and even now at
the age of 84 he is above the average in build. He owns his home and his
is the last colored family to remain in this neighborhood which is
rapidly being built up with modern homes.


George has little education, unlike his wife who is much younger and
uses fairly good English. He sits on his porch and thoroughly enjoys
talking of the long ago with those who appreciate listening to his
story.


"Benton Hill?" he said. "Sure, it's hanted. I seen things and heard
things there lots of times. Good gosh amighty! One night we was driving
through dere and we heard something dat sound like a woman just a
screaming. Old man Ousbery was with me and he wanted to stop and see
what it was but I says, 'No you don't. Drive on. You don't know what dat
might be.' Another time we's driving by there, and dey was a great big
mule just standing cross de road and he just wouldn't move. I says,
'Just drive on and he'll get out of de way.' But he didn't. When we gets
to him, he just parts right in de middle and half stands on one side and
half on de other. We didn't look 'round. No, mo'--we just made dat hoss
go.


"I don't know what makes dem hants round there--lessen it's de gold
what's buried dere. And you know de spirits always come back fer gold.
Sure dey's money buried dere. Didn't you all know dat? Lots of folks is
dug there, but dey ain't never found it. Why dey is holes 'round dere
where men's been digging for dat gold.


"Dey was one man had a-what you call it? A 'vinin' rod. That points to
where things is hid. But he didn't find it neither. And then out by de
Maberry place, close to Gordonville--who-e-e--I's sure enough seen
things out dere lots of times. You know where dat clump of peach trees
is at de corner of de fence? Dey always seems to come from right there.
I worked out there for a long time. We'd get out to work early,
sometimes 'twasn't good and day.


"One morning I's coming along there, on a hoss I was, and I met a
hossman. He looks funny to me and when he asks me something I says, 'Git
on. I ain't talking to you!' But he says, 'Wait, I wants to talk to
you!' As I says, he looks funny to me and I pulls out my pistol. I
always carries my gun, and I think if he makes a pass at me I'll git
him. But I goes on without looking back. Now just dat one man is all I
seen, but when I gets past, dey is lots of talking like dey is six or
eight men. But I didn't look back.


"One morning I'd got out there real early, too early to go into de field
and I thinks I'll rest awhile under de tree. I had my eyes shut for a
while when something bothered me. When I opened up my eyes there was a
lot a strange hosses standing 'round me in a ring. I jumped up and
hollered, 'git out'. Dey turned and ran and dey run right off a steep
bank on the other side of de field."


"Did you see them down there?" he was asked.


"Cose I never, nobody else never neither, dey wasn't dere, dat's why,"
he answered.


"Lord, when I thinks of de way we used to work. Out in de field before
day and work till plumb dark. My boss would say, 'George take two men,
or maybe three men, and git dat field plowed, or dat woods patch
cleared'. And he knowed if he tell me, de work would be done.


"And I worked at anything. One time I steamboated for eight years. But
what do dese young folks know 'bout work? Nuthin'! Look at dat grandson
of mine, just crossed de porch--why he's fourteen and he can't even use
a ax. Too young? Go on with you!


"I tells you dese young folks just don't know how to work. Dey has too
much studying up here (pointing to his head and making motions like
wheels going round.) When I's his age I's working at anything I could
find. I worked on a farm and on a steamboat, I carried cross ties--just
anything where I could earn money. And I saved money, too. When we
bought dis house I had $2,400 saved up. And men was stronger in dem days
and had better health.


"Dese young folks want too easy living. And dey ain't brung up to show
respect to old folks like we is. If I goes down de walk and a bunch
young folks is coming along, I knows I's got to step out of de
way--'cause dey won't give any. And if some little ones on roller skates
is coming down de sidewalk--you better git off or dey'll run right into
you.


"I was tellin' you 'bout Miss Katie coming to see me, wasn't I? Well
just last week her boy come to see me. He's maybe 25 or 30 year old.
Somebody told him 'bout me and he come here and he sit right dar on de
porch fer a hour and talk with me. He was a fine young man, he was."


    *Interview with George Bollinger*
    *[TR: by Mollie E. Smith].*


NOTE: George Bollinger and his family live in a nice one-and-one-half
story house, which they own. They have always been industrious people
and their home is nicely kept. George is 84 years old and seems to enjoy
life. He was glad to talk over "old times", especially after he
recognized me, (The "Me" being Mollie E. Smith) and recalled that he
used to work in my grandfather's Tan Yard. George Bollinger is living at
320 N. Spriggs St., Cape Girardeau, Missouri.


"We lived out on de edge o' Bollinger County. 'Ole Massa's' name was
'Dal Bollinger'. 'Ole Missus,' we always called, "Aunt Polly". Den day
wuz young 'Massa Dave,' and young 'Missie Katie'.


"My Pappy's name wuz 'Bollinger' 'en my mammy wuz 'Temple'. My pappy wuz
a smart man. He cud read and write. I don't know whar he learned it. An'
he had de power, my daddy did. He cud break a 'Hoodoo' spell, an' he cud
tell things dat happened wen he diden see it--If one a' de folks went to
town he cud tell 'em jes everything dey don dere.


"Dey wuz 'bout 20, mebby 25, slaves on de place, 'en we all lived in a
big, old log house. My mammy wus a good cook 'en she cud spin en weave.
She made all de clothes we wore. Us chilluns never wore no pants--jes
sumpin like a long shirt made o' homespun. We didden know nuthin' 'bout
learnin'. Dey wuz a church, but we didden go much, 'en we never had no
kind 'er gatherin's. Dey wouldn' let de cullered folks congregate--no,
shu, why, even de man over at de store wouldn't let mo' dan two cullud
folks come in at a time.


"I didden even know what money wuz. Massa' had a chest 'bout three feet
long--up in a little attic. It wuz jes' full o' gold 'en silver
money--no 'greenbacks'. It wuz covered over wif rugs, 'en I never know'd
what wuz in dere--we used to go up der to play sumtimes on rainy days,
an Aunt Polly'd holler, 'Ef you don' cum down fum dere de ghosts 'ul git
ye'. I never seed inside de chest 'till dey bury it--dat wuz in
war-time. Dey put a big hand spike under it 'en de men carry it down by
de sugar grove de udder side o' de graveyard. I cud go, right now 'en
show you de very spot dey bury it. De bes' times we-ens had wuz going
fishing, an' man! did we like to fish. Allus we had Saturday atternoon
off, 'lessen it wer wheat harvest 'er sumthin' special like. 'En
Sunday's we allus fished all day long.


"One time day wuz two hundred sojers cum to our place--dey wuz
Southerners, an' dey wuz nearly starved. Massa tole 'em _dey_ cud kill
dat big steer. Dey shoots him 'en 'fore he drops dey wuz on him;
skinnin' him. By dat time udders had a fire built 'en de men pull out
dey knives 'en dey cut off hunks; dey puts 'em on a stick 'en hol's 'em
ovar de fire a few minutes--didden give 'em time to cook thru fore dey
et it. Dat ole steer didden last long. 'En 'Massa' had ten cribs 'er
corn. He tole' em to ---- dey selves. 'Bout dat time a dispatch came,
dat de "Yankees" wuz commin'. Dey went up to meet 'em, 'an dey had a
battle over at Patton. Long 'bout midnight sum of 'em came back,
wounded. Aunt Polly helped 'em, but she begged 'em not to stay dere, or
de "Yankees" cum in, burn de house down.


"Aunt Polly 'en mammy allus know'd whut to do when a body wuz ailin'.
Dey allus had a bag o' yarbs hangin' under de porch. When de sojers wuz
commin' we allus hid de hosses. Massa' had lots ob 'em, 'en Missie ----
had de pudttiest black mare. It's name wuz 'Kate'. Des one time de
hosses musta skered 'er sumpin--de sojers foun' 'em, an' here dey com
ridin' up past de house wid every on of our hosses.


"A sojer wuz ridin' 'Black Kate'. Wen 'Missie Katie' see dat--she
holler, and she ran an' grab hol' de bridles, on han' on each side 'er
his haid. De sojer put spurs to de mare, but she hung on jes a cryin'. I
kin jes see her now; de mare a rarin' and 'Missie ---- hangin on
a-cryin'. She hung on till dey reach de creek. Den she lose her grip,
but she sho' did cry.


"One night we had a big corn shuckin'. We shucked 'till way late in de
nite: den sum de white men stay all nite. Day wuz a pile 'er shucks
higher'en dat door. Nex' mornin' a bunch o' "Yankees" cum by. As dey wuz
comin' thru' de yard, dey see one man runnin' to hide behin' de barn.
Dey say; "Halt", but de man keep runnin'; so dey fire--de bullet thru'
his had and he stop. Den dey say: "If day's one man, dey's more a
hiddin.' Dey looks roun', den de haid man say: 'Men ride thru' dat pile
'er shucks 'en ---- in dey hair. Den de sojers asks 'em things 'en iff'n
de answers didden seem good; dey hit 'em over de haid wid dere guns. I
wuz standin' right here, an' I saw 'Ole Massa' git hit on de haid once,
den anudder time: an' he fell. I sho' thot he wuz daid, but warn't. Aunt
Polly fix him up atter de sojers wuz gone, but de bushwackers got him.


"Dey must a heerd about de chest o' money he had buried. Dey try to make
him tell; but he wouldn't. Den dey put 'er rope 'roun' his neck an'
pulls him up. Den dey lets him down: but he wouldn' tell no how--so dey
finished him.


"Yes, de' nigger buyers ust'a cum roun' our place. It was sight to see!
Dere 'ud be mebbe five 'or six men a'ridin' fine hosses an a-drivin' a
whole flock 'er slaves along de rode; jes' like stock, all chained
togedder.


"On time dere wuz Pete Smith, 'Ole Tom Johnson, an' Fred an' Sam
Daughery; all niggar buyers--dey wuz at our place an' dey wud all sit
dar, an' us slaves had to stan' up in front o' em, an' dey'd bid on us.
I 'members I wuz full chested an' dey laid a stick across my chest to
see how straight I cud stan'. 'Ole Pete' Smith wuz gonna' buy me; but my
young folks begged 'Massa' not to sell me, 'cause we'd all played
togedder--so he didden' sell me.


"But dey wuz gonna buy my 'pappy' an take him way off, but, my 'pappy'
was smart. He had made baskets at night an' sold 'em when he cud, 'en
saved de money--dat night he goes to de fireplace an' lifts up a stone;
an' out o' de hole he pulls out a bag a' money an' he runs away. I ain't
never seed my 'pappy' since. Las' I hurd a' him he was in 'Indiana.'
When Mista Lincoln made his Proclamation (dat wuz 'fore de war wuz
over), young Massa' Dave set us free. He gave us a yoke of oxen an' a
wagon full o' everythin' we needed. Der wuz a feather bed 'en quilts an'
meat an' purvisions--an' he sent us into de Cape--an we been livin'
roun' here ever since.


"All my white folks is daid 'cept 'Missie Kattie', an' do you know, some
year back: she cum to see me. Yessir; her car druv up, right der, to de
sidewalk, an' she made all her grandchillun get out an' shake han's wif
me. She sho' wuz a fine woman!


"'Ku Klux?' Yes, dey wuz aroun' sometime', but dey didden bother ef you
mind your own bizness. But de darkies better not congregate; 'caus' day
shore take 'em out an' flag' em. If dey ketch you at a neighbor's house
atter dar, you shore better have a pass fum yo' 'Massa.'"

    *Interview with Annie Bridges,*
    *age 81, Farmington, Missouri.*


"I's born on March 6, 1855; on Wolf Crick, in St. Francois County. My
muthuh, Clausa McFarland Bridges, wuz borned on Wolf Crick too, but mah
fauthar, Jerry Bridges, kum from Californie. William McFarland wuz our
boss, and he had a lotta' slaves. Us liv'd in a log cabin, with two
rooms. Yep, there wuz a floor an' we had a bed, but hit hadn't no
mattress; jus' roped an' cord'd. Holes wuz in de side ob de bed, soo's
de ropes cud go thru'. We all wore 'jeans' an' wrap'd an' ole sack
'round our legs; most time we went barefoot. We al's used catnip tea ta
cure mos' ever'thing. Our boss wuz purty good ta us, but we larned dat
ole M.P. Cayce, he wuz a slaveholder, wud beat 'Hunter' Cayce, an' ole
'nigger' man, every Monday mornin' 'til his back bled. Den he tuk salt
an' put hit in de gashes. My brudders war, Alvin, Jerry, Rubin, Louis,
an' Nat. Ma sista' Mary, she went to Rolla an' married. Me an' ma
bruvver Jerry air de only ones a-livin'.


"I married Overdie Southerland wen I wuz 26 years ole. Abe Koen married
us, but we are not a-livin' togeth'r now. I never had no childr'n by
him. Ma furst job wuz with Dr. Jim Braham fur one year, an' nine months.
I got $2.50 a week. I did all de housework thar.


"After de war wuz over my muthuh went to Pilot Knob to wurk in a hotel.
Me, an' my muthuh went hup on Pilot Knob, berry huntin', one day, an' we
seen de leg ob a man an' his ankle bone wuz stickin' in his shoe. Thar
warn't any flesh on de leg. Hit wuz near de ole Fort (Fort Davidson)."
(Note: This must have been a portion of a soldier, from the Battle of
Pilot Knob!)


"Ma muthuh tole' me dat dey used ta sell de little childr'n away fum de
breasts ob der muthuh's. Ma muthuh plow'd in de fiel' an' wud leave her
baby layin' at one end ob de fiel', while she plow'd clear ta de odder
end an' kum back. She know'd a man who had a child by one ob his slaves
an' den sole de chil' as a slave. Wasn't dat turrible, sellin' his own
son?


"De young folks calls us 'ole fogies', but we knew how ta act, an' lots
ob de young-un's don't know dat now. When I wuz growin' hup we had
company an' would hav' ta wait 'til de ol' folks wuz thru' eatin' 'fore
we cud eat. Sum' ob my muthuh's friens' kum one day with their
'redique'; ([TR: reticule] bags which held knitting and sewing, and were
tied with a draw-string, at the top.) "They war eatin' an' I wuz sittin'
on a ladder dat led hup to de attic. I come down de ladder and wuz
sittin' near de bottom an' dese grown people's was eatin', den dey lean
back ta rest a-while, den eat a little more, an' res' a-while. I had ta
sit dare an' watch dem. After a-while I says: 'My time now'. Well, jus'
for dat, my muthuh give me one ob de worse whippin's dat I ever had.
Sometimes I had ta stan' in de closet, or stan' on de floor an' hol' one
foot, when I wuz punished.


"Ma muthuh's stepfather wuz poisen'd in whiskey. His name wuz 'Charlie
Gipson'. Onc't a man held hup a bottle an' said: 'I'm drinkin' de poisen
off'. But he wuz puttin' de pois'n in. After dat, Charlie Gipson drank
de whiskey out ob de bottle an' in nine months he wuz daid.


"Simon cud call de snakes an' dey wud kum frum all directions. He wud
tak' de skins ob dese snakes an' put dem on de roof ob de shed, an' den
when dey wuz dry, he wud mak' powder out ob dem an' 'hoodoo' people.


"We all went tuh a pahty one time an' Scot Cole's sistah et a big apple
thar. After a little while, she died. So's ma muthuh tole us to not eat
anythin' dat people give you; hit might be poisen'd.


"I'se been tole dat if people dies satisfied, dey don' kum bak, but if
dey don' dies satisfied, dey kum back. But I never seed nothin'."


(One of the religious songs used to be):


    "Jesus in his chariot rides
    He had three white horses side by side
    When Jesus reached the mountain top
    He spoke one word, the chariot stop
    He's the lily of the valley, O my Lord."


(Following, is a 'Love Song' she sang; which she learned as a girl when
attending play-parties):


    "I'm wandering down to Graybrook Town,
    Where the drums and fifes are beating
    The Americans have gained the day
    And the British are retreating.


    My pretty little pink,
    I used to think that you and I would marry,
    But since you told me so many faults
    I care nothing about you.


    I'll take my knapsack on my back
    My rifle on my shoulder
    I'll open up a ring and choose a couple in
    To relieve the broken hearted."


(Following is a song she learned as a child):


    "I'll tune up my fiddle
    I'll rosin my bow
    I'll make myself welcome
    Wherever I go


    Rye whiskey, rye whiskey,
    Ain't no friend of mine,
    He killed my old daddy
    And he injured my mind."


(Following is a song she learned as a child):


    "Rain, rain, rain all around
    Ain't goin' rain no more
    And what did the blackbird say to the crow?
    You bring rain, and I'll bring snow


    Rain, rain, rain all around
    Ain't goin' a-rain no more
    Old Hawk and buzzard went to roost
    The hawk came back with a loosened tooth.


    Rain, rain, rain all around
    Ain't goin' a-rain no more
    I had an old hat and it had a crown,
    Look like a duck's nest sittin' on the ground.


    Rain, rain, rain all around,
    Ain't goin' a-rain no more."


(Following is a speech she gave as a small child) [HR: Not ex-slave]:


    "I love the cheerful summertime,
    With all the birds and flowers.
    I love the gentle flowing streams,
    I love the evening breeze,
    I love to go to school.


    To read, write and spell
    I love my teacher's smile again
    And get my lessons well."


(Following is a speech given as a child) [HR: not ex-slave--white
version]:


    "Hear the children gayly shout
    Half past four, school is out
    Merry, merry, playful girls and boys
    Thinking of games and toys
    Slates, sleds, dolls and books
    Oh how happy each one looks
    'Now for snowballs', Harry cried
    And to hit his sister tried
    Sister Flora full of fun
    With her little hand making one
    At her brother Harry threw
    Swift it flew and hit his nose
    'Have I hurt you brother dear?'
    Asked his sister running near
    'No indeed', said he
    'This is only sport for me.'"


(Following is a familiar prayer when she was a child) [HR: not
ex-slave]:


    "Savior, tender shepherd hear me
    Bless the little lambs tonight
    Through the darkness be they nearest
    Watch my sleep 'til morning light
    Bless the friends I love so well
    Take me when I die to heaven
    Happy there with thee to dwell."


(Following is a very familiar song:)


    "'Dear mother,' said a little fish
    'Pray, is this naughty fly
    I am very hungry and I wish
    You would let me go and try.'


    'Sweet innocence', the mother cried,
    And started from her nook,
    'The hurried fly is but to hide
    The sharpness of the hook'.


    So he thought he'd venture out
    To see if it was true
    Around about the hook he played
    With many a long look.


    'Dear me', to himself he said
    'I'm sure it's not a hook'
    So as he fainter, fainter grew
    With hallowed voice, he cried,
    'If I had minded you
    I would not then have died'."

"In de ole days we live in Arkansas, in Greene County. My mammy wuz
Mary-Ann Millan, an' we belong to 'Massa' John Nutt, an' 'Miss' Nancy.'


"Our white folks live in a big double house, wid a open hall between. It
wuz built of hewed logs an' had a big po'ch on de wes' side. De house
stood on Cash rivuh, at the crossroads of three roads; one road go tuh
Pocahontas, one tuh Jonesburg, an' one tuh Pie-Hatten (Powhatan).


"Now whut fo' you wanna' know all dem things? Air ye tryin' to raise de
daid? Some o' 'em, ah don' wanna see no mo', an' some o' 'em ah wants to
stay whar dey is. Pore mammy! Ah shore had one sweet muthuh, an' ah
wants huh to stay at rest.


"De wuz jus' us one family o' cullud folks on de place. You see, 'Miss'
Nancy' hired us fum her fathuh, 'Ole Massa Hanover. Jes' mah mammy an'
huh chillern. She had five, 'fore de war wuz ovuh. Our daddy; he wuz an
Irishman, name Millan, an' he had de bigges' still in all Arkansas.
Yes'm, he had a white wife, an' five chillern at home, but mah mammy say
he like huh an' she like him. You say ah don' look half white? Maybe I's
fadin'.


"We live in a little ole log house, it wuz so low a big feller had to
stoop to git in. Our folks wus mighty good tuh us, an' we stayed dar wid
'um after we's freed.


"Ah don' rightly know how old ah is, but de priest writ' it all down fo'
me, when ah's gittin' mah pension. Sho' ah's a Catholic. Is they
anything else? Fo' fifteen year ah tended de Catholic church, swept an'
dusted, an' cleaned, but ah's too ole fo' dat now, an' ah's po'ly in mah
back, cain't git 'round like dat no mo'.


"We lived de ole-time way of livin', mammy done de cookin an' we had
plenty good things to eat. Mammy made all de clothes, spinnin', an'
weavin' an' sewin'. Ah larned to spin when ah wuz too little tuh reach
de broach, an' ah could hep her thread de loom. An' mammy wuz a
shoe-maker, she'd make moccasins for all o' us.


"Two o' the Nutt boys made shoes too, heavy, big ones dey wuz; but dey
kep' our feet warm in winter.


"An' dey had a tan hand. Ah uste wade barefooted in dem pits an' work
wid dem hides, but ah wouldn't wanna do it now.


"Dey wuz a grove o' post-oak timber, 'bout five, or six acres, all
cleaned out; an' in der, dey raised bear cubs. Why, dey raised 'em tuh

tuh sleep! M-m-m!


"They wuz fruit trees planted all 'long de road, planted jes' like
fence-posts for 'bout a mile, an' all de fruit dat fell in de road de
hogs got, we'ens could go get any of it, any time, an' travelers, 'long
de road, was a'way's welcome ter hep dey selves. 'Massa' nevuh planted
no shade trees. Iffen trees wuz planted dey had to be fruit trees.
'Ceptin' de holly bush, he like dat 'cause it's green in winter.


"They wuz some flowers 'round de house. Snow-balls, batchelor-buttons,
old-maids; jes' such old-fashion ones, no roses, n'er nuthin' like dat.


"Massa' raise some cotton, but 'Ole Massa' Hanover had sech a big cotton
patch yuh couldn't look across it. An' dey all kind'a fowls yu'd find
any where's, guinie's, ducks, n' geese, n' turkey's, n' peafowl's, an'

"My mamma could hunt good ez any man. Us'tuh be a coup'la pedluh men

trade with 'em fer calico prints n' trinkets, n' sech-like, but mos'ly

'er marning' dey's a'way's shore busy. An' folks in cities goes tuh
pawks now to see sech animal. Hun! Ah seen all 'em things ah wants tuh

"Good Lawd! We didden' know whut church wuz n'er school nuther, an' the
whites nevuh nuther. Dey wuz a couple o' men us'ta come by, an' hole a
camp meetin'. Dey'd build a big arbuh, with branches o' leaves over de

"Yes'm, we seed sojers, an' we seed lot's o' 'em. Dah wuz de
'blue-coats'; some o' de folks call'em Bluebelly Yank's, dey had fine
blue coats an' the brass buttons all ovuh the front o' 'em shinin' like
stahs. Dey call us little cullud folks', 'cubs', an' dey burn down
Jonesburg. Yes'm we seed Jonesburg down in ashes. Dem 'blue-coats' wuz
devils, but de 'gray-coats' wuz wusser. Dey turn over our bee-gums an'
dey kill our steers, an' carry off our provisions, an' whut dey couldn't
carry off dey ruint. Den dey go roun' killin' all de cullud men an'
bayanettin' de chillern.


"No, dat wuzzen' de 'gray-coats' doin' de killin', dat wuz 'bushwackers'
an' 'Ku Klux'ers', dey sho' wuz bad. Dey shot my little sistuh in back
of her neck an' day shot me in de laig. See dat scar, dat whar dey shoot
me. An' dey kill my gran'fathuh; dey sho' did.


"Gran'fathuh's name wuz 'Jim Hanover'. 'Ole Massa Hanover', he wuz a
lawyer, an' he educated mah gran'fathuh tuh be a overseuh. He lived wid'
'Massa Hanover' for long time. He wuz a good man, mah gran'fathuh wuz,
an' he wuz smart too, an' when de war surrenduh, dey make him Mayor of
Pie-hatten, an' he made a good mayor too; people all said so, an' dey
wuz gonna' 'lect him fo' foe mo' year, an' de 'Ku Klux'ers said dey
wuzzen' gonna have no 'nigguh' mayor. So dey tuk him out an' killed him.
Dey wuz awful times. Now you know dat wuzzen right an' who's de curse
fo' such things gonna rest on?

"Der wuz two white men say dey'd get us to Cape Girda. Dey had two
covered wagons, an' dey wuz forty-eight o' us cullud folks. We put our
belongin's in de wagon. Dey wuz a coupl'a ole gramma's rode in de
wagons, an' some little feller's, but de rest of us walk ever step o' de

sleep unduh de wagon so tired we nevuh even know'd it wuz rainin'.


"When we got to St. Francis Rivuh dey ferried us across on a big flat,
an' had a rope tied across da rivuh to pull us ovuh. But we had to ford
White Watuh, an Castuh rivuh, an' Niggerwool swamp. When we'd come to de
rivuh de white man 'ud say: 'Ack like sojers'. De hosses 'ud swim
across, pullin' de wagon, some o' de big folks 'ud grab hole' de feed
box an' de rest 'ud each grab roun' de one in front an' dat way we fords
de rivuhs, wid strings a' folk hangin' out behin' de wagons.


"Hoo-doos', ghosts's er signs? No mam! Ah don' believe in none of dat.
Now you is tryin' to call up de devil. But wait! Ah kin tell you one

around. Us little fellers had to help carry in de wood, and help do de
feeding. Dey had lots of hosses, cows, and pigs.


"Dey was a separate house for de spinning and weaving. Cose all our
clothes and shoes too, was made on de place. Massa was mighty good to
his cullud folks. He never 'lowed none of 'em to be sold and I don't
recollect ever seeing anyone getting whupped. No, we never had no
gatherin's nor schools, nor nuthing of the kind.


"Massa had a fine big carriage and one Sunday he'd take all de white
folks to church and de next Sunday, he put de cullud folks in de
carriage and send dem to church. Dat's how come us to be Catholics. We
come all de way to Cape, to St. Vincent's Church, down by de river. We
lived away off dere in de backwoods and we didn't see much of
sojers--jes' a few scattered ones come by after de skirmish at de Cape.
When de war ended, we moved to de Cape and work on de college farm.


"When I's little de mostest fun we had was going fishing--we spent most
of our time down dar by de branch and I guess de big folks was glad to
have us out of de way."

    *Interview with Richard Bruner,*
    *Negro preacher, Nelson, Missouri.*


The subject of this sketch, Richard Bruner, is one of the oldest negroes
in Saline County. He claims to be ninety-seven years old and lives in
the little town of Nelson.


His humble dwelling, a gray and weathered frame building of about four
rooms and two porches, sets in a square of yard thick with blue grass,
old fashioned flowers like holly hocks, flowering pinks and marigolds
making bright spots of color. Heavily laden fruit trees, apples,
peaches, plums and pears shade every part of the plot. A splendid walnut
tree towers over the smaller fruit trees, the house and the porch, while
at the side of the house a garden spot contains a fine variety of
vegetables.


As the writer approached, the old man was seated on a cot on the little
porch. The wall back of him was hung with all kinds of tools, a saw, a
hammer, bits of wire, a piece of rope, part of a bridle, and a wing,
apparently from a big gray goose. His long curling, gray hair is neatly
parted and brushed and he wears a mustache and short beard or chin
whiskers, an unusual thing among negroes in this part of the country.
His skin is a light brown color and his eyes bright with his second
eyesight which enables him to look on the world without glasses.


Back of the house and down the hill, is a well equipped slaughter house,
where for many years this old man has taken care of the butchering of
the meat for his white friends and neighbors. He is too old now to take
charge of this work, but the house and equipment is still in good
repair.


This aged Negro has been for many years a highly respected preacher of
the gospel. His own account of his life and adventures follows:


"Yes'm I remembers before de war, I remember being a water-boy to de
field hands before I were big enough to work in de fields. I hoed
tobaccer when I was about so high, (measuring with his hands about three
and one half feet from the floor).


"Yes'm dey thrashed me once, made me hug a tree and whip me, I had a
terrible temper, I'm part Choctaw Indian. We went to de white folks
church on Sundays, when we went to camp meeting we all went to de
mourners' bench together. De mourners' bench stretch clear across de
front of de Arbor; de whites and de blacks, we all just fell down at de
mourners' bench and got religion at de same place. Ole Marsa let us
joine whichever church we wanted, either de Methodist or Baptist.


"No, I never went to no school, de colonel's daughter larnt me to write
my name, that was after de wah. No'm, dey didn't care if we had dances
and frolics. We had de dances down at de quarters and de white folks
would come down and look on. Whenever us niggas on one plantation got
obstreperous, white folks hawns dey blowed. When de neighbors heard dat
hawn here dey come to help make dat obstreperous nigga behave. Dey
blowed de hawn to call de neighbors if anybody died or were sick."


In response to the question as to where he joined the Federal Army,
Bruner replied:


"Well you see I was a runaway nigga; I run away when I was about grown
and went to Kansas. When de war broke out I joined de 18th United States
Colored Infantry, under Capt. Lucas. I fit three years in de army. My
old Marsa's two boys just older than me fit for de south. Dey was mighty
good boys, I liked dem fine."

    _Slave Married 4 Times_


"I was born out by Caledonia and is 75 years old. My mother came from
another family. My old master bought her from another man. She died when
I was about eight years old and my father died about forty years ago.
His name was George Bryant but he went by de name of Brock. I was livin'
in Pilot Knob when Price's raid come through. De government gave de old
man a team to make it to St. Louis. Me and my mother and my brother who
was deaf and dumb went with dem but de soldiers captured us and de old
man jumped off de mule and high tailed it to de woods. My mother got out
of de wagon and took my brother to de woods too. De soldier rid up to de
wagon and said, 'Little boy, you don't need to be afraid, I'm after your
father.'


"I started to get out of de wagon and fell down under de mule and dere I
was on de ground. I got up and made for de woods and got in a hole where
de hogs was a-wallerin'. I had on a dress and was standin' in de mud up
to my knees. I got lost out in de woods for three days. I just laid
around and slept behind a log at night and durin' de day I played in dat
mud-hole. If I see'd somebody comin' in de woods I would go and hide.


"A colored lady found me after three days and called me and took me
along. I stayed with her three weeks before my mother found me. I like
to eat up everything dey had when I first got something to eat after
bein' in de woods so long. We went from one place to another and along
about two o'clock in de night you would hear something hit de house like
hail. Den we had to come out of dere and hit for de woods. We would go
to another house 'bout eight or nine miles away and I'll be switched if
dere would not be hail fallin' on dat house about two o'clock in de
mornin'. It was them bushwhackers again. We kept runnin' for about three
weeks. We would go to peoples' houses for food and some of dem would
give us enough food to eat for two or three days.


"I'll show you now how my mother happened to find me. One night we was
in a old house and we didn't dare talk loud 'cause we was afraid de
soldiers would hear us. We was afraid to light a light. All at once my
mother who was in one side of de room said: 'I wish I could find my
little boy.' Den de lady I was with said: 'I found a little boy playin'
in de hole where de hogs wallowed. Come over here and see if dis is your
boy.' So my mother come over and said: 'I can't see him but I sure can
tell by puttin' my hand on his head.' So she put her hand on my head and
said: 'Yes, dat's sure 'nough my boy.'


"But I wouldn't go with her. I wouldn't leave dat other woman. About 2
o'clock dat night de hail began to hit de house and we had to git out.
So I went with de other woman and it was about two or three days before
I would go with my mother. Two or three days later we all met again and
my mother said: 'Don't you know your mother.' I knowed it was my mother
'cause my brother what was deaf and dumb was with her. Den I went on
with her. I would talk to my brother with signs.


"Den we went to a little place away, away from Pilot Knob. Den my mother
was free and she said, 'Robert, we is all free.' I was too young to know
anything 'bout it. After we was free we put in a little stuff in de
ground. We had to go to de woods to get some brush and make a brush
fence around de garden to keep de cattle out. We got permission from a
man dat owned a farm to build our own log house. It took two or three
days to build a one room house. We made up some mud with water and made
it stiff enough to stick to de chinckin'. Den we cut a big hole in one
end of de building and got some flat rocks and made a fireplace. We put
mud on de inside and outside of de chimney. Sometimes de chimney would
catch on fire and we had to run to de branch to get water and put it
out. Sometimes it would catch on fire twice or three times in one night.


"We took old gunny sacks and put leaves in dem to make a bed and we
slept on de floor and had a old spread and de white folks gave us some
old quilts. To make a fire we got some spunk out of a log and then took
two flint rocks and to-reckly it would make a spark and catch that
spunk. We banked de fire at night.


"We never had no doctor. My mother would go out in de woods and get
herbs and if I had de stomach ache we would put a little bit of
turpentine on a piece of sugar. If I had de headache we would put a
piece of brown paper and vinegar or horse radish leaves on de head. In
two or three hours us kids would be out playin' and kickin' up our
heels. We would go out and get some goose grass and make a little bit of
tea and pour it down for de stomach ache. We would get dis black root
for constipation. We used a turnip and scraped it and would bind de foot
when it was frost bit.


"I'se been married four times and had children by two wifes, had eight
children altogether and all are girls but two. Ain't but one living and
dat is Ed McFadden what's livin' in Fredericktown, Mo. He works for
Deguire at de lumber mill and has been workin' dere for about 30 years.
Most of my children died young, but three girls lived to get married.
I'se married three times by a preacher and once by de squire.


"I steamboated six years on de Mississippi between St. Paul and New
Orleans. I got $1 a day and board, and we sure would pack dem sacks and
sing dem songs. De old mate would holler at us: 'Give me a song boys'.
And den we would start out. It 'peared like de work went ahead easier
when we was singin'. It would take us four weeks to make de rounds
before we got back to St. Louis. We hauled potatoes, sheep, wheat, corn,
cattle, horses, and cotton. There was 45 of us altogether. I never got
hit but one time on de boat. De mate with knucks on hit at another
feller for 'cause he was loafin' and hit me and knocked me and my load
in de river. I couldn't swim but dey fished me back in de boat and
rolled me over and over to run dat water out of me. I run on de 'Bald
Eagle' and de 'Spread Eagle'. My mamma got after me to quit and when I
got hit she got uneasy about me, but I would hear dat whistle blowin' my
feet'd begin to itch and I could not help but go down to de old boat
again. De old mate had my name 'doubled up'. It was Bob Rob.


"Den I went to wheelin' iron ore at Sulphur Springs. All day long I
worked with 16 men loading barges with wheel barrows. Every time you
took a load it had 800 pounds, and I'se telling you all, dat's some
iron. This iron ore came from dat big hill down in Pilot Knob. We had
straps over our shoulders and dey saved our hands and arms. It took
about a day and a half to load a barge and we got paid by de ton. I did
dat for about a year.


"I give my wife all my money and all de time she was givin' it away to
another man. So dat was when I left her flat and went down to
Charleston, Cairo, and Kentucky and stayed three years. I was workin' in
de tobacco for three years. Dere was too much stoopin' in dat and I
decided to come back to St. Louis. We only got $12 a month in de tobacco
fields and worked from 4 o'clock in de morning to 8 or 9 o'clock in de
night time. Dere was 9 or 10 in de tobacco field.


"Den I worked in de iron foundry in a St. Louis furnace. I carried iron
and hustled in de casting hole. Dey paid pretty good and we got $1.50 to
$1.75 a day. I worked up dere two years and den come to Sulphur Springs
and went on de farm and got $26 a month. I got to be a trusty and dey
put it in my hands. I worked here five years for old Mike Green. I was
single den. I went down on John Coffman's farm in Ste. Genevieve County
to work for him. Worked on his farm for 'bout 15 years and got $26 a
month and board. He had a gang of 'em working for him. He had rows of
cabins 'most a mile long. Dat was where I got married a second time.


"After I left dere I went down below Fredericktown and went on a farm
again and stayed right dere for seven years. I lost my wife at dat place
and sold my land. I paid $90 for 40 acres dere and had paid 'bout half
on it. So I sold it back to de man what I bought it from for $45 and
went to Bonne Terre and worked for de St. Joe Lead Co. and worked on de
lead well and den went to tappin'. I got $1.60 for 12 hours. I worked
dere until dey moved de works up here and den I followed de works right
up here. Den I worked 'bout 30 years here doing de same kind of work
with the same pay.


"When I quit workin' here it was about 13 years ago and I was about 62
years old. De company just laid me off on account of age. Den de
supervisor dere got me a job as janitor at de colored school here at
$7.00 a month. I've been janitor ever since. Dere is ten colored
families in Herculaneum, and about 50 colored people here now but dere
used to be mostly all colored but most of 'em done left. I lived here in
dis house a little more dan 5 years without payin' rent. Den after my
son got on the WPA dey begins to take $3.85 rent a month. We been payin'
rent 'bout two years. The St. Joe Company owns all de houses here. We
gets our water free. I'se been gettin' a pension about a year now.


"I shot a fellow once in de leg. It was de man who my wife was givin' my
money to. I had a trial at Kimmswick before de Justice of Peace and
served three months in de county jail at Hillsboro. The white folks come
down and got me out and it didn't cost me a thing.


"A man has got more his own say now dan he did have. We can do more what
we want to and don't have to go to de other fellow. Slavery might a done
de other fellow some good but I don't think it ever done de colored
people no good. Some of dem after freedom didn't know how to go out and
work for demselves. Down at old John Coffman's lots of dem stayed with
him right along same as if dey wasn't free. Dey didn't want to leave
here 'cause dey didn't think dey could live if dey left him. But when
dey got away up here in St. Louis dey know they can make a livin',
without Marse John, but they got to 'go up against it.' Dependin' on
somebody else is poor business. When I was workin' I depended on myself.
If dey would have freed de slaves and give dem a piece of ground I think
dat would been a heap better dan de way dey did. Look at de Indians!
They're all livin'. I'se always been able to eat and sleep.


"I can't hardly tell about de younger generation, I can say dat if it
was not for de old generation today de young ones would go up 'salt
creek'. Dey don't want to work. Some of dem is pretty smart. Pride is de
reason dey don't want to work. Dey dress up and strut out and have a
good time. De old folks is de cause of it. Dey say, 'I don't want my boy
to do dat; I don't want him to work hard'. I say, let him make out de
same as us old folks did. If de colored people don't pick up and see
about business dey is going to be behind. Dese young people won't go to
church. You can't get dem in dere. Dat's de place dey ought to go. I'se
been goin' to church since I was a boy. Colored folks did not raise me.
White folks learned me to go to church. Mrs. Baker, at Cook's
Settlement, would read de Bible every night at 9 o'clock and she would
'splain it to me. If she was not able, her daughter read it. We need a
workhouse for de young people.


"De first time I ever cast my vote was for Garfield who got killed. It
was in Kimmswick. Been votin' ever since, and vote all through dem all.
I'se been talked to lots of times, tellin' me how to vote. Dey even give
me a ballot and show me how to vote. I would stick dat in my pocket and
vote like I pleased. I ain't never sold my vote but I'se been offered
$10 for it. But I say if you is goin' to get beat, I say you is just
beat. You ain't no man to go over there and cast your vote. You got to
stand for your point.


"De first automobile I ever seen had buggy wheels. It made a terrible
racket. Mrs. Baker told me dat people was goin' sometime to be ridin' in
automobiles and in de air."

The wonderful meteoric display known as the "star shower" or "the time
when the stars fell," occured in 1833. It was on the night of the 12th
and 13th of November. Many ignorant persons concluded that the Judgement
day had come, or that the end of the world was at hand. Negroes
especially were very much frightened. A dance was in progress on a
Buchanan County farm, attended exclusively by slaves from the
neighborhood. When the star shower began the negroes were first made
aware of the fact by a messenger who ran frantically into the cabin and
shouted, "If you all wants to git to hebin, you'd better 'gin to say yo'
pra'rs mighty sudden, 'cause the Lawd is a-comin' wi' de fire an' de
glory an' de wuld'll be burnt up like a cracklin' 'fo mo'nin."


The dancers ran out, fell on their knees and cried for mercy. Not for
many days did they recover from their fright. One old negro declared
that if the world and his life were spared he would agree to break
eighty pounds of hemp every day instead of fifty, as he had been
accustomed to do.


The Negro was a part of the early Buchanan County family. They were
black slaves and happy.


The negro Mammy had her proper place in the scheme of things. She was no
fiction of a later day novelist, but genuine, gentle, untiring, and
faithful. The Negro mammy merits a prominent place in the picture an
artist might paint, for on her broad shoulders was carried the
generation which made the early history of Missouri fascinating and
great.


When once a week came "Johnny Seldom"--as the hot biscuits made of wheat
flour were called in Old Missouri--all other kinds of bread faded into
nothingness. Two kinds of biscuits were typically Missourian--the large,
fluffy, high biscuits--which looked like an undersized sofa pillow--and
beaten biscuits, small, crisp, delicious--the grandfather of all
afternoon tea refreshments. No "Po' white trash" can make beaten
biscuits. Indeed, much of the finest flavor of all cookery belonged
intuitively to the Negro. How the Negro cook managed to get biscuits
steaming hot from the cookroom a quarter of a mile distant through the
open yard to the dining room table has always been a mystery. She did
it, however, and successfully.


Mr. Alex Bufford, an ex-slave, lives at 1823 Seneca street, St. Joseph,
Missouri. Mr Bufford, (everyone calls him Uncle Alex) does not know how
old he is, but says he does remember that he was a grown man at the time
of the Civil War.


I heard about Uncle Alex from one of the ladies in the reference room at
the Public Library in St. Joseph, Mo. She told me I would have to see
Uncle Alex right at the noon hour or in the evening, as he would be at
work during working hours. I didn't ask her what kind of work he did but
I heeded her advice about seeing him at the noon hour. I arrived at his
place about 11:50 A.M. As I got out of my car I happened to look up the
alley. An old Negro driving a one-horse wagon was just entering it. I
guessed in a minute that this was the old gentleman I wanted to see.
When he approached I did not tell him at first what I wanted but started
talking about the weather. I saw in a minute the old fellow was going to
be interesting to talk to.


After we had commented about the weather, I told him what I wanted.
Uncle Alex, "Ya sir, I'll be bery glad to tell you anything I kin
recollect, but I don't remember like I used to." He said, "I don't know
how ole I am, but I was a grown man at the time of de war and I guess
I'se de oldest man in de city. I was born in Buchanan County and have
libed here all my life. I only been out de state once in my life and dat
wuz ober to Elwood seberal years ago. (Elwood, Kansas is only about 2
miles west of St. Joseph.) I'se just don't keer to go any place."


To my question about his family he replied. "Ya sir, I hab four
daughters and one son libing, but da don't help dis ole man any. Until I
got de ole age pension seberal months ago, I had a terbil time making a
libing."


Uncle Alex and his brother who is younger than he, live together. The
brother is an old man more feeble than Uncle Alex.


After the War Uncle Alex worked on the farm for the Conetts, near
Faucett, Mo. in Buchanan County for several years. Then he moved to town
and worked for the same people in their brickyard until just a few years
ago.


The house Uncle Alex lives in now belongs to the people he worked for so
long. He lives there rent free.

    *aged 75, Fredericktown, Missouri.*
    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*


"I've lived here 'bout 65 years. I was born in slavery on de Hill place
in Farmington. My mother's name was Catherine. Father's name was George.
A brother and sistah of mine was sold as slaves 'fore I was born. I
nevah saw them. My father was sold away from my mother. Our home was not
pleasant. The mistress was cruel. Her brother would go down in de
orchard and cut de sprouts and pile 'em up under de house so as de
mistress could use 'em on us. She also used a bed stick to whip with.


"One day we took de cows to pasture and on de way home I stopped to
visit Mrs. Walker and she gave me a goose egg. And den when we got home
de old mistress kicked me and stomped on us and broke my goose egg.
Did'n mind de whipping but sure hated to break my egg.


"Our cabin was one room, one door and one fire place. Our mistress was a
rich woman, and she had three husbands. She had a big square smoke house
full of hog, beef, deer, all pickled away. She had 12 cows and lots of
butter and a spring-house.


"To eat we had corn meal and fried meat dat had been eaten by bugs. We
had some gravy and all ate 'round de pans like pigs eating slop. And we
had a tin cup of sour milk to drink. Sometimes we would have
gingerbread. Dis was 'bout twice a year.


"My brother dat was a slave ran off with four or five other boys and
never come back. He went west and died in Honolulu. They had a
'niggerbreaker' in Farmington who would take care of de slaves who were
hard to handle.


"Once it got so cold dat de chickens froze and fell out of the trees and
de mistress gave each of us a chicken to eat. We had no shoes even in
winter. I can't 'member having good clothes.


"One of our neighbors, Mr. McMullin, was a poor white but he had a heart
and was our mistress' guardian. I was too little to do much but I would
walk along de furrows and hit de oxen with a stick. My sistah come and
got me after freedom and learned me de alphabet. De first thing I ever
learned to read was, 'I see you Tom. Do you see me?' I worked for
intelligent people and learned a great deal. After I married I wanted to
learn a great deal and how to read. At de camp in Mine La Motte I went
to school in a log house for 'bout two months.


"Dey would whip with a cat-o'-nine-tails and den mop de sores with salt
water to make it sting. De traders would come through and buy up slaves
in groups like stock. On de way south dey would have regular stopping
places like pens and coops for de slaves to stay in; at each of these
stoppin' places some of de slaves would be sold. My uncle's father was
his master and de master sold my uncle who was his own son.


"When my mother died I did not know what a coffin was or what death was.
So I went to my dead mother where she was on de cooling board and
brushed my dress and said, 'Look at my pretty dress.'


"There was a tough gang called patrollers. Dey would scare de Negroes
and would keep dem always afraid. De mistress would take a couple of us
young ones to church but when we got home things were different.


"And I never seen so many soldiers in my life before or since than when
Price come through on his raid. It was apple pickin' time and de
mistress made us gather apples and pack 'em to the soldiers and we had
to pack water from de spring to 'em. De mistress had pickets out in
front of de house when de soldiers was in town.


"Once when de Union soldiers was in town a negro soldier come and got
him a turkey off de fence. De next night a white soldier come to get a
turkey and he looked all over de place and come up over de stile. Den de
mistress goes out on de porch and called de dogs and said, 'Sic the
rogue'. De soldier took out his pistol and laid it on de fence and
waited awhile and looked. De dogs were jumping up against de fence. So
de soldier shot de dog and then went off and got on his hoss again.


"One day a Union officer come up and had a saber and said he would cut
off de mistress' head. De officer was a Dutchman. The mistress then ran
to town for help. De soldier came right in de cabin and said, 'Me no
hurt you.' De soldier went in de safe in de house and ate all he wanted
and den went to bed in de house. Finally de law come and moved him out
of de bed off de place. De soldiers would come at night and rout de
slave women out of bed and make 'em cook de soldiers a square meal."

    _Sold Slave, Ill Luck Followed_


"I did not get to see my daddy long. He served in de first of de war and
come home sick and died at Cadet. I was born at Cadet. I lives here in
Festus and am 90 years old. My mother was Arzella Casey and was a slave
in Cadet. Tom Casey owned both my mother and father. De master had a
pretty good farm and dat was where I worked when I was a boy. Mr. Casey
never hit me a lick in my life. He was sure good to us. I had an uncle
John and dey had to sell him 'cause dey could not do anything with him.
Dey took him to Potosi before dey sold him. He did not want to be drove.
Mr. Casey said if he had 100 niggers he would never sell another one. He
said he never had any more good luck since he sold John. Losing his
children was his bad luck.


"Before freedom we had our own house and stayed here after freedom. My
master said, 'Well, Joe you are your own boss.' I said: 'How come?' He
said: 'I'll help you.' Dey would not turn us out without a show. We
stayed dere free and I went out in de diggin's in de tiff at Valle
Mines. Some days I made $5 and den some days made $2. White folks would
come and get ma and she would go to help kill hogs and clean up de lard.
Dey paid her good. We must have stayed about 3 years at Casey's after de
freedom and den went to Mineral Point and worked for de tiff and
mineral. I married up dere and had about 13 children by 2 wives. I ain't
got no wife now. Dey is both dead. My children is scattered so I don't
know how many is livin'. I got a boy dat went to this last war and I
think he is out west somewhere. I got two boys here. One is workin' for
de factory in Crystal City. De other one knows lots about cement. I got
another child in New York. They don't write to me. I can't read or
write. Dere was no school for niggers dem days. I has to make a cross
mark every time I do anything. I went to school one week and my mother
had to clean tiff to make a livin' for dem children and get grub so I
had to go to work. I had about seven sisters and brothers altogether. I
done worked at everything--steamboating, cutting wheat in Harrisonville,
Illinois. I was here when dis was all woods, man. Me and a saloon keeper
have been here a long time, more'n 50 years I guess. I pay $5 a month
rent or just what I can give 'em. My two boys lives here with me now and
I get $12 pension.


"Dat's when my old master run when dem blue jackets come. Dey made me
kill chickens and turkeys and cook for 'em. De lieutenant and sergeant
would be right dere. De master would go out in de woods and hide and not
come out till they rung de bell at de house.


"I voted since I been 21. I voted for Roosevelt twice. Some thinks he is
goin' to get in again. What's the use of takin' money from a man for
votin' a certain way? If I like you and you have treated me good all my
life den I'll vote for you.


"I don't know what I think about de young Negroes today. Dey is all
shined up and goin' 'round. If dey can read and write dey ought to know
de difference between right and wrong. I don't think dey will amount to
much. Some of 'em ain't got no sense. My mother would not let me stay
out. Now, dat is all dey doin'. Last night de policeman put a knot on my
boy's head; he was drinkin' and got into it with a coon. De young
colored people is fightin' all de time. I don't get out. Just go to de
store and come back home again. Dere is a house right near where dey has
a big time every night. De whites and black ones was mixed up here till
I stopped it. Right down in dat hollow I'll bet you'll find one-third
white women livin' with black men. Most all de colored people around
here is workin' in the works here at Crystal City. Dey will get up a war
here if they keep on, you just watch, like they did in Illinois when dey
burnt up a heap of coons. It's liable to get worse de way dey is goin'
on."

    *Interview with Lula Chambers,*
    *St. Louis, Missiouri.*
    *(Written by Grace E. White.)*


The subject of this sketch is Lula Chambers who is not certain of her
age. However she knows she is past ninety and that she was born in
Gallatin County, Kentucky near Virginia. She lives with a granddaughter,
Genevieve Holden, 2627 Thomas Street, St. Louis.


Lying ill in a three-quarter metal bed in the front hall room of her
granddaughter's 4-room brick apartment, the old lady is a very cheerful
person, with an exceptionally fair complexion. Her brown hair is mixed
with gray and she wears it quite long. Her room is neatly furnished.


"I was born in Gallatin County, Kentucky, more than ninety years ago,
slaves didn't know dere age in them days when I come along. I do know I
was born in July and my mammy's name was Patsy Lillard. I don't know
nothing at all about no kind of father. Course, I had one but who he was
I never knew. I ain't never even seen my mother enough to really know
her, 'cause she was sold off the plantation where I was raised, when I
was too young to remember her, and I just growed up in the house with
the white folks dat owned me. Dere names was Dave Lillard. He owned more
dan one hundred slaves. He told me dat my mother had seven children and
I was de baby of 'em all and de onliest one living dat I knows anything
about. They sold my mother down de river when I was too young to
recollect a mother. I fared right well with my white masters. I done all
de sewing in de house, wait on de table, clean up de house, knit and
pick wool, and my old miss used to carry me to church with her whenever
she went. She liked lots of water, and I had to bring her water to her
in church. I had so much temper dey never bothered me none about nursing
de children. But I did have a heap of nursing to do with de grown ups.


"I used to get a whipping now and den but nothing like de other slaves
got. I used to be scared to death of those old Ku Klux folks with all
dem hoods on dere heads and faces. I never will forget, I saw a real old
darkey woman slave down on her knees praying to God for his help. She
had a Bible in front of her. Course she couldn't read it, but she did
know what it was, and she was prayin' out of her very heart, until she
drawed the attention of them old Ku Klux and one of 'em just walked in
her cabin and lashed her unmerciful. He made her get up off her knees
and dance, old as she was. Of course de old soul couldn't dance but he
just made her hop around anyhow.


"De slave owners in de county where I was raised--de well-to-do ones I
mean, did not abuse de slaves like de pore trash and other slave holders
did. Of course dey whipped 'em plenty when dey didn't suit. But dey kind
of taken care of 'em to sell. Dey had a great slave market dere dat
didn't do nothing but sell slaves, and if dey wanted a good price for
dem de slave would have to be in a purty good condition. Dat's what
saved dere hides. My owners had a stock farm and raised de finest stock
in Kentucky. Dey didn't raise any cotton at all, but dey shore did raise
fine wheat, barley and corn, just acres and acres of it. De worse
lashing our slaves ever got was when dey got caught away from home
without a pass. Dey got whipped hot and heavy den.


"In Arkansas many of de slave owners would tie dere slaves to a wagon
and gallop 'em all over town and would dey be banged up. I saw a strange
niggah come to town once and didn't know where he was going and stepped
in the door of a white hotel. When he saw all white faces, he was scared
most to death. He didn't even turn around he just backed out and don't
you know dem white folks kilt him for stepping inside a white man's
hotel by mistake, yes they did.


"I can't tell you any pleasure I had in my early days, honey, 'cause I
didn't have none. If I had my studyin' cap on, and hadn't just got over
dis terrible sick spell, I could think of lots of things to tell you,
but I can't now. Right after de war dey sent colored teachers through de
South to teach colored people and child, do you know, dem white folks
just crucified most of 'em. I don't know how to read or write. Never did
know. I am de mother of five children, but dey is all dead now. I have
two grandchildren living, and have been in St. Louis seven years. I come
here from Helena, Arkansas. My husband was a saloon keeper and a barber.
He died in 1880 in Brinkley, Arkansas. I nursed and cooked in Brinkley
after he died for fifteen years for one family.


"I wears glasses sometime. I have been a member of de church over fifty
years. My membership is in Prince of Peace Baptist Church now and has
been every since I been in St. Louis. God has been so good to me, to let
me live all dese years. I just want to be ready to meet him when he is
ready for me. My only trouble will be to love white folks, dey have
treated my race so bad. My pastor, Rev. Fred McDonald always tells me I
will have to forgive them and love dem if I wants to go to heaven. But
honey, dat's goin to be a lifetime job. I don't care how long God lets
me live, it will still be a hard job.


"I gets an old age pension. It is very little, but I thank God for dat.
I have nothing left to do now in this world but to pray. Thank God for
his goodness to me and be ready when He comes.


"Dis rheumatism serves me so bad I can't be happy much. Wish I could
remember more to tell you but I can't."


The old woman is well preserved for her years.

    _Peter Tells How Slavery Began_


"I'se 83 years old and was born in Ste. Genevieve County and my old
slave-time place was in New Tennessee about 14 miles west of de town of
Ste. Genevieve. My master had only my mother, my mother's brother, and
an old lady by de name of Malinda. My mother had six children but only
four of us lived to be grown. Father was owned by a Mr. Aubushon right
dere at Coffman. Mother come from way south in Kentucky and she was
owned by a Master Calvin dere and when him and de mistress died de
slaves had to be divided up among de children. Den my mother's mistress
left Louisville and brought her here to Missouri. When mother come to
Missouri she was only 9 years old.


"My old mistress, I can't say a hard word about her. Before I was borned
she was left a widow and she treated us almost like white folks. She
took care of us and raised us up. Mother died after she had six children
and we was left in de care of dis old mistress. The Catholic people
treated us like as if we was free. My mother and father was married by
de priest and it was lawful. But dese other ones was married by de
master hisself. When dey married de master could pick up any old kind of
paper and call it lawfully married. An almanac or anything would do. But
what was it? The colored people didn't know A from B and wasn't allowed
to learn to read. If my master or mistress would see me readin' a paper
dey would come up and say, 'What you know about reading a paper? Throw
dat down.' Dis was done to keep us from learnin' to read anything.


"After we got free what did we do to get lawfully married to our
slave-time wife? Understand good now. Den de squire came around and we
had to get married all over again under de new constitution. It would
cost $5. When de master first married us he would say in de ceremony
something like dis:


"'Now, by God, if you ain't treatin' her right, by God, I'll take you up
and whip you.' The girl's mistress would chastise her de same way. I
would choose who I wanted to marry but I had to talk to my master about
it. Den him and de owner of de girl I wanted would get together and talk
it over.


"Dere is lots of people right today who can't tell you how de new
constitution come up. In slave time, young man, we was stock, like
cattle and hogs. If I killed 50 men nothin' was said about jail, but we
got whipped den. Dat was your sufferin' for what you done done. Man, I
never got but one whippin' from my master. I can tell you just how it
come. It was done through takin' care of an old cow. Now, in dem times,
son, dere was not gates like dere is now. You called dem 'slip bars',
and would let down a rail fence called bars to let the cattle in.
Understand, listen at it good now. Every mornin' I had to go up to de
straw stack and drive de cows to de barn. To milk dem we had to drive
dem down a lane to de house for de old cook woman to milk. As I drove
dese cows dey all got through de gate but when de last cow come through
she fell over de bottom rail and de master was standin' at de window and
saw dis happen. De snow was about three feet deep. Now listen good. De
old master was crippled and so here he come with a walkin' stick in one
hand and a cowhide in de other.


"He said, 'By God, I'm goin' to learn you, by God, how to let down
bars'. I said, 'Marster Jim, I let down every bar 'cept dat one on de
bottom'. He jumped on me and got me down in dat snow till I couldn't see
him at all. Every time he raised up an' come down with dat cowhide it
cut through de snow and hit me. I didn't had nuthin' on 'cept an old
pair of socks around my feet. You know if you was raised from birth like
dis you could stand it. It come to me, I thought dat if I ever get to be
a man I would pay de marster back for dat.


"And so after dat when we got free I was growin' on 13 years of age. My
aunt and brothers come and got me. My old master was a shoemaker, and
one day my uncle told me to take a pair of boots and take dem over to
have half-soled. I taken dem over. I had not come across the old master
since de time we was free until dis day. But when I went in de house de
family was around dere and I forgot about payin' him back for de way he
done treated me. Jim's mother who was dere said, 'Well, Peter, don't you
wish you was back here livin' with us again?' I said, 'No, mam.' Den I
went in de kitchin and talked to Jim's wife. She was a Republican and
said, 'Wasn't dat hateful what she said about you bein' back here
again?' De next time I met my old master, Mr. Galvin, was on de road. He
was walkin' and could hardly drag. I was ridin' my horse and thought
about gettin' down and whippin' him but when I looked at him I thought I
might as well be whippin' a year old child. I let him go.


"Later on Jim got poor and one day I met him at de saloon in Staabtown.
He wanted to get some leather from another store. He asked me if he
could have my horse. I said rather sharp, 'No, I won't.' Den I thought
and said, 'Mr. Jim, I'll go and get de leather myself.' So I got de
leather and taken it to his home and set it in on de porch by his door.
Den he said, 'Peter, I thank you a thousand times. Any time you need
anything in de shoe line come to me.'


"Later on he was down and out and he come to his sisters. Dey could not
take care of him so dey put him in de asylum in Farmington. I met him in
Farmington on lots of days, and felt like payin' him back for dat
whippin'. But just looked like every time, God would say, 'No, don't do
dat. He will pay for dat. He will come down'. And he sure did pay for
it. He died in de asylum out from Farmington. I never mentioned about
dat whippin' to Jim Galvin, not a nary time.


"When I was freed I felt like I was goin' into a new world. It was de
daughter of de old mistress what told me I was as free as dey was. It
was dangerous around de house durin' of de war. So de old mistress broke
up de old place and us boys was given to our godmother. Mary was my
godmother and it was here I was told dat I was free. We was little and
didn't know which way to go. My mistress said, 'Now Peter, you are free
and de first chance we get we are going to send for your aunt to come
and get you.' Dere were four of us brothers bein' taken care of by four
sisters, when we was free. My uncle was in de army and served two years
and had come home. He asked my aunt, 'Where are dose boys?' My aunt
said, 'Dey is still with de white folks.' So my uncle come to get us.
When he come he rid up and we was so glad to see him we run out and met
him. He said, 'Boys, I've come after you.'


"We walked up to de house. Den de white folks was just as glad to see
Uncle Julius as if he had been their brother. Den Uncle Julius said to
my godmother, Mary, 'Well, Miss Evely, I come after Pete.' She said,
'Julius, I'm awful glad you've come to get him, I hate to give him up,
but take him and take good care of him.' Julius was told de same thing
by all de other godmothers of my brothers. All of dese sisters had de
winter clothes for us cut out but dey wasn't made. De white women said,
'All your aunt has to do is to make dem.' We had between nine and ten
miles to go to get down to my aunt's home.


"My aunt's husband was freed at least 15 years before de war started.
His master died and he was freed by a will when the master went to de
court house in Ste. Genevieve. Now, just listen good. Dis master willed
800 acres to his slaves who divided up de farm. Before he died, he put
it down in a way dat his daughters and sons-in-laws could not break it
'cepting dey would raise several thousand dollars. De old slaves would
sit down and tell us about it. De master turns in and pays de taxes up
for 100 years. One of de trustees for de will was a Dr. Herdick and
Henry Rozier both of Ste. Genevieve. My uncle's part was 40 acres and it
was dis farm where I went when I come out from under de shelter of de
white folks. De colored would sell 2 or 3 acres at a time and all dis
farm is now sold. I was 13 when I got free and went to dis farm and
there was my home until I was right at a grown man. De only taxes we had
to pay was on household goods and stock. Every year when de personal
taxes come due I would go into Ste. Genevieve to pay de taxes. As long
as Dr. Herdick and Henry Rozier lived as overseers we was well protected
on de farm. But Ed Rozier, a lawyer, tried to get us to pay de other
kind of taxes.


"I was goin' on 20 or 21 before I left de farm. De old lady and Uncle
died about de same time. Dey took de old lady to de River Aux Vases
Catholic Church to bury her and I stayed with de old man and he died
before dey got back from de funeral. We sold our forty acres and dere
was six heirs. Den I went to work on a farm of Mr. Aubushon for $10 a
month for 15 years. When I quit Aubushon I went den out in Washington
County at Potosi and stayed with my two uncles out dere. I served in a
iron factory dere for about two years. Sometimes I would get $5 a day.
Den when de price would fall off I would get less. Den I come back to
Ste. Genevieve County and worked by de day and den went to St. Louis. I
worked dere from one iron factory to another and so den I quit dat.


"Den I 'run the river' three straight years from St. Louis to Cairo and
Memphis, and Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. I den quit de down trade and
rested up and made de northern trip from St. Louis to St. Paul.
Everything had to be sent from de South out to California. Dat boat had
nothin' on it 'cept eatin' things. So my aim was to get out to
California to dig gold. I got defeated in dis way.


"De river got so low dat we would be tied up for 3 or 4 days before we
could unload it. And we never made it to de port where we could unload
it to send it to California. From dese ports you went by land with a
covered wagon and oxen or mules. It would sometimes take 6 months to get
to California from de time we left de river. My way would have been free
because I could drive a team out to California. But I never got to go
'cause de river got so low. I quit de river work and done some farming
for first one den another down in Ste. Genevieve County for a couple of
years.


"Dey was just startin' up at Crystal City. Dere was lots in de paper
about it. Now and den William Kimer, who was livin' in Jefferson County,
wrote me to work for him. I would work for him from May to December
durin' de wheat cuttin', thrashing, corn pullin' and wheat sowin'. Den
dere was no more summer work, so Crystal City was just startin' up and
dere was no railroad and dey got everything by boat and teams hauled de
things from de river up to de plant. Sometimes there was from 50 to 60
farm teams down at de river haulin' de coal, brick, etc. for de company.
Sometimes we would make $15 a day for de farmer man and he would pay me
$10 a month and board. Den I went to Crystal City and worked 13 straight
years. De most dat ever I got dere was five or six dollars a day. Dis
would be about every three months w'en we tore down de furnace and built
it back. At other times I would get about $4.50 a day. I done
everything. Made mortar, carried de hod and brick and when quittin' time
come you was tired. After I quit Crystal City I went down in Ste.
Genevieve County and farmed and got married and had two children. My
wife and one child, a little girl, is dead. I live here with my son and
his wife. My son has been workin' for de St. Joe here for 12 or 13
years. I had to quit work when I lost my eye-sight.


"I was grubbin' hazel-nut bushes in dem rich bottoms in Ste. Genevieve
County; and one day I was runnin' and fell down on a stob and it went
through my left eye. Dis happened about 40 years ago. De other eye was
good till I was 45 and den I had de loss of both eyes and been blind
ever since. I'se been gettin' a blind pension for 22 years. It is $75
every three months.


"Dere is only one colored family here dat owns their house. All de
others rent from the company. I vote at every presidential election, but
dat's about all I ever do vote. I been votin' for every president
election since I was 21 years old. From de beginning to de end it's
always the same, the Republican ticket. Dey joke me a good deal around
here 'bout voting one way.


"As I look back on it, people ought never to have been slaves. Dat was
the low downest thing dat ever was. De first startin' of slavery was
when a white man would go over to Africa and de people over dere was
ignorant and de white man would hold up a pretty red handkerchief and
trade it for one of de Negro women's children. De Negroes in Africa was
too ignorant to know better and dis is de way slavery started. I always
said like dis, when de older ones that knowed de things, dey ought have
learned de slaves their names as dey was in Africa. Lots of us don't
know what our grandparents was in Africa. Slavery didn't teach you
nothin' but how to work and if you didn't work your back would tell it.
Slavery taught you how to lie, too. Just like your master would tell you
to go over and steal dat hog. Den de other master from who I stole de
hog would say, 'Peter, why I've lost a hog; did you ever see him
anywhere?' I would say, 'No, suh'. Of course if I did not lie I would
get a whippin'.


"De white people did not want to put us in a state to ourselves after de
freedom 'cause dey couldn't do without us. De colored people done come
up too high now to back 'em and dey got a better chance. De conditions
now of de colored people is of course better now 'cause dey is somebody.
But every day dey is tryin' to starve us out and give de white man a job
on de state road. Dey do dat to keep us down. Dat's done more now dan
ever before. It's been worse since Roosevelt got in dere. When Highway
61 was put in from St. Louis down to Festus de colored man had a part to
do. Since Roosevelt got in dey won't even let a colored man walk down de
highway."








Ed Craddock




    *Interview with Ed Craddock,*
    *Janitor, Saline County Court House,*
    *Marshall, Missouri.*


    _Veteran Janitor_


Marshall, Missouri has a life-long negro citizen who was born in
slavery, but was too young to remember actual slave conditions. He is Ed
Craddock, born a few years before the Civil War, the son of slaves owned
by leading pioneer families. Craddock lived through the hard days of
reconstruction. His own father was a school building janitor in Marshall
in the 1870's, and Ed Craddock was apprenticed under his sire, finally,
upon death of the latter, succeeding to the job, which he has held for
forty-seven years. Years ago he married and reared a large family.
Craddock belongs to the Methodist Church, serving as "second
minute-man", which he explains is something like a secretary, and also
belongs to the Colored Masonic Lodge. Craddock's brother is a practicing
physician in St. Louis.


"Stories told me by my father are vivid," Craddock said in an interview.
"One especially, because of its cruelty. A slave right here in Marshall
angered his master, was chained to a hemp-brake on a cold night and left
to freeze to death, which he did. My father said slaves had to have a
pass to go places. 'Patrollers' usually went in groups of three. If they
caught a slave off his plantation without a pass the patrollers often
would flog them."


Craddock relates that his father suffered from chills and fever which,
quinine, the only remedy known then, failed to cure. Someone advised
him, next time the chill came on, to plunge into a deep and cold hole in
the river. Ed says his father, out of desperation, tried the suggested
cure, and it worked, in a way squaring with the modern medical theory of
setting up a counterirritant in certain cases.


Craddock's mother was owned by the family of Marmadukes, one of whom was
an early-day governor of Missouri.








Isabelle Daniel [TR: Mrs. Eli Daniel]




    *Interview with Mrs. Eli Daniel,*
    *Marshall, Missouri.*


An aged negress answered the door when I knocked and asked if this was
Isabelle, she invited me into her parlor, a tiny room with a rather
good-looking brussels rug upon the floor, and panel lace curtains hung
at the windows. The walls were hung with enlarged crayon pictures of
Isabelle's husband and their sons and daughters; no other pictures adorn
the walls. The center is the old family Bible occupying the place of
honor; all the births, deaths, and marriages of the family have been
carefully recorded in this book. An album holds next place and contains
many old fashioned pictures of her "white folks" and friends of her
younger days.


The outside of this little four room house is quite attractive, it was
formerly painted white, but not much paint clings to it now; old
fashioned green shutters still hang at the windows, a tiny little
portico shelters the front door. There is room at one end for a small
porch swing to be hung. At the other end an old weather-beaten chair
affords a resting place for the caller.


The yard is entirely enclosed by a fancy wire fence, and a concrete walk
leads to the porch.


This old woman lives entirely alone in this little cottage which was
provided for her many years ago by the will of her old master.


She says she is 87 years old, but circumstances seem to indicate that
she is at least 90; she said she was married and had a child about a
year old when the war closed in 1865.


Her work as a slave was almost all in the house; she was taught to sew,
and had to help make the clothes for the other slaves. She also was a
nursemaid for her mistress' little children and at one time was hired
out to the methodist preacher's family to take care of the children when
his wife was ill.


She remembered joining the "white folks" methodist church in old
Cambridge and going to church on Sundays and sitting in the Gallery,
which was the place reserved for colored people in that particular
place.


On Sunday morning Aunt Cindy got "happy" at the services and began to
throw herself about and shout; the white folks on the seats below
hurried to get out from under the edge of the balcony for fear Aunt
Cindy would lose her balance and fall over the railing to the floor
below.


Isabelle is a Firm Believer in "hants."


When she was a girl the adjoining plantation was owned by her master's
brother-in-law, and on this plantation was the big old tobacco factory
where the tobacco raised on several neighboring plantations was priced
and hung. The negroes on her master's place said this factory was
"hanted." None of them would go near this factory after nightfall, for
"when the nights were still and the moon was full, you could hear the
ting, ting, ting, of the lever all night long and voices of the slaves
crying out and complaining, and you knew there wasn't anybody there at
all, jest hants."


Isabelle was a mid-wife by profession after the war, and tells this as
one of her experiences.


She was caring for a lady that had just had her second child; they lived
in a cottage with a full basement under it.


The father was to take full care of the other child, a little boy, at
night, and they were to sleep in the basement. The father and little son
tried to sleep in the basement for two or three nights, but the father
could not sleep. Something bothered him as if restless spirits were
abroad. One morning Isabelle said she was standing by the door when she
heard a voice, low and vibrant, saying, "No sleep here. Can't sleep
here." No one was there but her and the mother and the two little
children, so, of course, she knew it was "hants". This was proved to her
satisfaction a few months later. The skeleton of a man was found under
the basement floor.

    _Henry Says He's 105_


Henry Dant, now living with his daughter on Davis Street in Hannibal,
was born in slavery on the farm of Judge Daniel Kendrick, south of
Monroe City in Ralls County. He is about one hundred and five years old,
in possession of all his faculties and is able to move around the house.
He seemed to have only hazy recollections, and it was difficult to keep
him from wandering from the subject. The following is the story that he
told:


"I was married and had three children when we was freed. The only slaves
Mr. Kendrick had was my mother, brother, sister, and myself. Mr.
Kendrick had three boys. Joe carried mail to Paris, and de other two,
Bob and Jerome, was school teachers.


"We was treated fair when we behaved ourselves, but we had to be
straightened out sometimes but we were not mistreated. We worked hard on
de farm. I cradled wheat and plowed corn often till midnight. We often
drove hogs to Palmyra and Hannibal. When dere was no crops in de fields
we made brooms and baskets. My brother died and den I had to do most of
de work. I was de only colored man on de place den. De Stage stopped at
Mr. Kendrick's place and I had to look after de horses and mules. De
mail come dere too, and dere was always a lot of people to be fed.


"Mr. Kendrick was judge of de court at New London and he was away most
of de time. He was a big man in de county in dem days, and I had to go
to town often. Once when I was driving to town with de ox team and wagon
during de war, dere was soldiers on de road like you never did see. I
tell you dem was bad times. I come back a different road because I was
afraid, and I run dem oxen most of de way home. I got dere all right,
but de oxen laid down on me once. De next morning one of the oxen was
dead and in about a week de other one died. Dey just couldn't stand de
running.


"Two of de master's boys got locked up over in New London or some place
during de war. Dey come back after the war was over.


"I played a fiddle for all de weddings and parties in de neighborhood.
Dey paid me fifteen or twenty cents each time and I had money in my
pockets all de time.


"When we was set free dey gave us a side of meat and a bushel of meal.
Dat's all we got. I went on a farm and farmed for myself, later I owned
a farm in Ralls County. We raised corn and pigs and drove de pigs to
Hannibal and Palmyra. When I got too old to farm I come here to live
with my daughter. I get a pension now for about a year. It's not very
much but it helps."

Masta' Joe Mott and Missus Mary Mott. Den dey was young Massa' James
Andrew an' young Massa' Joe, an' dey wuz Missie Ophelia an' Missie Mary
Rebecca.


"Dey had a nice big house, white wid big porches an' big locust trees

good many er us.


"My Daddy wuz Henry Litener and my mammy wuz Rosanna Litener. My daddy
belonged to Woodson Morris. He wuz a cousin of Massa Joe Mott an' lived
a few miles away. He wuz allus allowed to visit us over Saturday night
an' Sunday. Mammy done de cookin' at de big house an' Massa Joe allus
said dey warn't nobody cud cook like Rose--dat's what he call her.


"We lived in a three-room log house an' we allus had plenty good eatin'.
Hams, puddi near all year round chickens, en' sweet'taters an' possums
too.


"Cain't tell 'bout no good times in dem days 'cause dey warn't none. We
didden have no church but Ole Missus Mary usta carry mammy along to her
church--ridin behind on her hoss. I guess dey wuz mos'ly right good to
us all. The chillern wouldn' never let nobody whup me 'cause we all
played togedder. But Ole Massa usta whup mammy when he'd git mad.


"When de war came Ole Massa didden go but he war a reg'lar ole seesesh!
Young James Andrew went off to war an' ole Missus usta grieve for him.
We ain't never seed no fightin' round our place but we could hear de big
guns over at Columbus. When de sojers was round de neighborhood dey'd
allus have me playing' round de front gate so I cud tell em when dey's
comin' up de road. Den dey goes an' hides 'fore de sojers gits dar. Dey
all skeer'd o' de sojers. I's skeerd too but dey say sojers won't bother
little black gal. De sojers jes' came in en' ransack de house--dey finds
sumthin to eat an' dey looks for money. Dey wants money! but dey don'
find none. Den dey wants ter know whar's my folks--but I tells 'em I
don't know. Dey jes left en' didden say whar dey wuz goin'.


"When de war wuz over Ole Massa Joe came in an' he say: 'Rose, you all
ain't slaves no mo'--You is all free as I is.' Den you should a heard my
mammy shout! You never heerd sich shoutin' in all yo' bahn days. An' Ole
Missus she joined in de shoutin' too. She war glad 'cause now James
Andrew would be comin' home.


"Old Missus Delia Reed, dat wuz Old Massa's sister, she wuz good 'bout
lookin atter us wen we's ailin' but iffen we's sick dey'd git de doctor.
Dey wuz jes as dutiful to us as to dere white folks.


"Dey usta talk--bout hoodoos an castin' spells en' sech like--but I

    *Interview with Mary Divine,*
    *St. Louis County, Missouri.*


    _Was Nurse Maid At 4_


The subject of this sketch is Mary Divine, 85 years old. She lives at
8004 Elinore Avenue, St. Louis County, Missouri, with her son and
daughter-in-law.


Her home is an old fashioned 3-room slate dwelling, with an abundance of
old furniture for such a small place. The little old woman was
interviewed while mending the pockets in her son's trousers. Her story
follows:


"I was born May 24, 1852 in Carroll County, Tennessee. My mother's name
was Mary Whitehorn, 'cause she was owned by de Whitehorns in dat county.
My father's name was James Farrow 'cause he was owned by de Farrows. De
slaves had to carry dere owners' names, married or what not. My mother
had three children. My first owner's name was George Whitehorn and his
wife's was Jackie Whitehorn. When old Marse George died, we was handed
down to Joseph Whitehorn in Miss Jackie's will. She knowed long before
freedom we were going to be free, so she had in her will dat her
darkies,--she always called us darkies--had caused dem to have all dey
owned and it was no more dan right when we git free to divide up de
plantation so every one of us could make a good livin' on de livin' we
done made for dem, and dey still own and have plenty. She was a good old
soul. She didn't want a one of us to leave, even after freedom been
declared. She said she would never live to see it and she didn't
neither. She died 'fore we was free, and dem chillun never did carry out
her will neither.


"'Cause dey didn't give a one of us nothin', no, nothin' at all. Put us
out wid just what we had on our backs, and dat was most nothin'. At 4
years old I had to nurse old man George's son, Joseph's baby, and de
baby was most big as me, but I nursed it just de same, honey. Dey put me
in dat family nursin' dat baby 'fore I was four 'cause dey put me dere
in January and I wasn't four years old till de incoming May dat same
year. I 'member dat right well. I nursed dat baby for two years, too,
and it sure was crazy 'bout me. I loved it too, yes, I did. Den after
two years dey sent me to work for de old man's oldest son, Jacob. Dey
made me do all de cardin' and spinnin', make ropes and ply lines, two
cuts a day, was my task and I stayed dere in dat family until after the
Civil War was over.


"I heard my father got killed in de Civil War. I never knowed for sure,
'cause three months 'fore I was born, his owners carried him away to
some other part of de country and we never seen nor heard from him no
more. Mother never did know what happened him, no she didn't.


"Just 'fore war was declared I was still young and small but just de
same I had to help pack brick to de moulders where dey would be building
brick chimneys, and work in de field, too. I had it mighty hard in dem
days, yes I did but den it wasn't hard as some others had it.


"I 'member during de war days, my old miss use to boast 'bout her
littlest darkey, done spun enough thread to clothe her whole family for
de next three years to come. For two years after freedom was declared I
worked from farm to farm and de promise we was going to get paid, but we
never got nothin' from none of dat work but de old slave cabin to sleep
in and food enough just so we could work.


"We had noboby down in dat country to make folks keep dere word and pay
a nigger, so we just have to keep on travelin'. After 'bout three years
later I cooked in de same county for a Bill Green. Got my board and keep
and $1.00 a week. He kept me 'bout five months. Dey never did keep us
long for pay. Den I went to John Carney's plantation wid my mamma. I
card and spun dere for 'bout one year and some weeks. We got $1.00 a
week and he was supposed to give us home made cloth to make us some
clothes for our work, but he never did do it. After dat we went to work
on Sub Allen's farm for $1.00 week. I took sick dere and dey had to call
in a doctor. My mamma and me worked for him a long time, but we got
ready to go and want our money he said, while I was sick it taken all he
owed us to pay my doctor's bill so we didn't git nothin' dere, but a
place to stay and we shore did work like slaves in all dem places, from
sun up till sun down just like in slave days. Only difference was we
didn't git a beatin' when we didn't suit. I couldn't make no money for
clothes or nothing so I just up and married and had eleven children. Den
my husband died. I had a child in dis last World War. He was my ninth
child and got took in de last draft. I never heard of him no more. Dis
one I'm living with named Ulysses Divine. He's de only child I got
living I know anything about.


"I been here in St. Louis since Wilson's first administration and worked
in de nut factory five years. I like to sew and do general housework. I
read, write and spell a little but not enough to speak about. I know dis
young generation's got a mighty fine chance if dey 'cept of it and
'preciate it. Course some do and some don't. I prefer living in town dan
out here but my son bought dis spot. I can't make my own living no more,
so I got to live on it. I git what de relief pretend to call help,
'tain't nuff for nothin' though. Dey claim I'll git a pension, but I
never seen it yet. I'll be dead directly and I won't need it. I can't
answer dem other questions 'bout what us slaves expect and voting, I
don't know."

Note:--While the interviewer was questioning Charles Douthit,
Farmington, Missouri, negro, who was born in 1865, his wife standing in
the door looked rather wild-eyed, and unable to stand it any longer,
finally broke out with the following:--"Say! What are they gittin' all
dis stuff fur anyway? I bet I know. They want ta find out how dey
treated de ole slaves so's dey'll know how to treat the young 'uns when
dey makes dem slaves. I bet they're goin' a try to have slaves again and
dere are some people who want slavery back but de people won't stan' fur
hit now. I don't know what de government wants to do but de people would
have a most turrible war if dey tried to have slaves again. But ma
muther who worked for John Coffman in Ste. Genevieve County, wuz well
treated. She war really owned by the Missus and de Missus would not sell
ma mamma. When de war wuz ober de missus gave ma muther some land an
built her a beautiful home down dare. Ma muther wuz treated so good dat
she stayed an worked fur de Missus til de Missus died. I was borned down
in dat dare house dat de Missus built fur ma Muthuh and ma son lives
dere now. I was down dere las week, an I calls hit home."

_Slavery_


"The slaves had a hard time, some of them. All the work was done by
hand. The slaves cradled the wheat. They raised hemp for clothes. The
old master had one woman who made clothes the year round for the hands.
We had to get a pass from the master to leave the place. If any of the
slaves got in trouble they were taken to the whippin' post. If they had
done a big crime they got 60 or 70 lashes with a whip, for a small crime
they got about thirty, if their master would not pay their fine. The
white folks went to singin' school then they would sing one or two songs
that's all they knew. They would have big basket meetings. All the
slaves had to set in the gallery when we went to church. Most everybody
went on hossback. Some of the farmers were good to their men and some
bad. When some farm had more slaves than was needed, he would hire them
out to some body or sell them. New Year's day was always sale day or the
day they would hire out for the year. When we wanted to get married we
had to ask the master and the girls' mother and father. All the married
man got Thursday night off to go to see their wives.


"At Christmas time we got a week off and we got Saturday afternoon off.
At Christmas the old boss would fix a big bowl of eggnog for us niggers.
The niggers were superstitious. They would not live in a house where a
sinner had died. There was an old man and woman lived down the road from
our house that fit all the time, and by that house after dark one night
one saw them walkin' around in the house. None of us niggers would go by
there after dark, we always rode around the place. People are lots
smarter now than they was then."

"I was born on October 13, 1854. My master was Henry Walker and we live
'bout three mile from Jackson. De house was of logs. One of dose big
double kind wid a open hall in between. Solomon Eulenberg was my father
and he was a big fine looking man. My mother come fum Tennessee when she
was ten year old.


"Master had nearly a hundred slaves and dey was about ten or twelve
cabins in de quarters. Dey was a big feeding barn where we'd hitch up
and go to work. De barn was built of big hewed logs, too.


"No'm, dey wasn't none of us ever try to run away. We had a good home
and we all stayed till dey declare peace and lots of us kept on a
staying 'cause we didn't know nothing else to do. But my father was
industrious--he worked hard and saved his money and in a couple of year
he bought a team and we moved to a little place.


"But lots of de cullud folks had it hard dem days--dey was jest turned
loose and didn't know what to do. Some of de white folks was mighty good
to 'em. If they'd hear of a family being hungry dey'd send food to 'em
or have 'em come to dey kitchen.


"A cose mebbe it don't sound right but in some ways I often wish we's
back in dem days. We had a fine place. Every year we'd kill seventy or
seventy-five hogs--and had plenty of every thing. We ate our meals in
our own cabin but every morning at seven, de colored housewoman went to
de smoke house to cut meat for de day. Us youngsters all ganged up round
her, hoping to get something. Lotsa times missus would ask us if we's
hungry and bring us into de kitchen and give us what dey had left.
Sometime she have de women make up pancakes for us. Us children had de
chores to do--and any work dat we's able.


"We didn't have no school. A woman come and stay all year round jest to
teach little Miss Lucy and she taught some of de cullud children to read
and write. Missus would have a preacher come once a month to preach. I
rec'lect his name was Rev. Watts. All of us would come into de big house
for meeting.


"Many a time we seen soldiers pass on de road but dey never molested us
none, 'cept to come in and eat everything that was cooked--and sometime
have de women cook up some more. One Sunday morning a bunch of 'em come
by--dey had been over to Burfordville and burned de mill. Another Sunday
a bunch of Rebs come by and camped 'bout a mile from our place. Dat
night de Blue Coats ran onto 'em. Dey killed about thirty. Next morning
us boys went over there and what we saw didn't suit me none. Some of de
cullud men helped to bury 'em.


"We had lots a good times in dem days. Us boys played marbles and ball
and other games like boys will. On Saturdays from five to nine we all
had off--den we'd congregate--and have singing and dancing. At Christmas
and such days we'd have a big time. When dey's a wedding missus always
dressed 'em and fixed 'em up. I rec'lect one time missus sold my mother
and four children but it wasn't no trade. De woman's name was Mrs.
Sheppard and she was a sassy old woman. She come into my mother's cabin
and grabbed her and told her she going to take her home. Mother jes'
pushed her out de door and said she wouldn't go--and she told missus she
wouldn't go--so dey had to call it off--it was no trade."

Ann Ulrich Evans




    *Interview with Ann Ulrich Evans,*
    *St. Louis, Missouri.*


    _Wed For Economic Reasons_


Although 94 years of living have dimmed her eyes a bit and the burdens
she's packed through the years have bent her wiry frame Ann Ulrich
Evans, a former slave, is still able to carry on. She lives in a rear
apartment of the slum district at 1405 North Eighth Street with her
daughter, Eliza Grant.


Ann declares she's had eleven children of her own and that from them
have sprung so many grand children and great grand children that she's
entirely lost count of them. The story of the incidents that have filled
her life but have still left her able to love mankind and smile follows
substantially in her own words:


"I was born March 10, 1843 on Dolphin Street, Mobile, Alabama. My
mother's name was Charlotte Ulrich and my father's was Peter Pedro
Ulrich. I am the mother of 11 children and we has over 100
grandchildren. Dere is so many great grandchildren and great great
grandchildren we jes' quit countin' when we comes to dem. I has four
generations, and dey give me a party three years ago, and so many of my
off spring come der wasn't any room for half of 'em and even dat was not
de beginning of de lot of 'em. I got a gang of 'em I never did see, and
never will see, I don't reckon. Dey just write and tell us dey got 'em.


"My father was owned by a rich old boss named Captain Bullmay. He owned
a raft of boats, and my father was a cook on one of dem boats. Mamma
only raised two of her children. De Ulriches sold me when I was a girl
to Dr. Odem in de same county, and I worked in his field, spun thread to
make cloth, pulled fodder, put de spinning in, and after a while, I
don't know how long, he swapped me off for two boys. My new owner was
Gilbert Faulkner. He was a railroad section man. I worked in de field
for him until we was set free. I had some good times and some bad times
both. De man I married worked on the railroad for him. His name was
Moses Evans. Dat was in Helena, Arkansas. My husband's been dead more
dan 30 years now. I got four daughters and three sons living and a host
of grand and great grand, and great great grandchildren living. Since my
husband died, I just live from one child to the other and some time de
grandchildren takes care of me, I havn't done no kind of work since my
children got big enough to work. Dey been pretty good to me all my days.


"'Bout a year ago de government done started giving me a pension, $11 a
month. It helps some, but don't very much, every thing's so high, honey.
When freedom come I asked my old owner to please let me stay on wid dem,
I didn't have no whar to go no how. So he just up and said, 'Ann, you
can stay here if you want to, but I ain't goin' to give you nothing but
your victuals and clothes enough to cover your hide, not a penny in
money, do no nigger get from me.' So I up and said, 'Why boss, dey tells
me dat since freedom we git a little change', and he cursed me to all de
low names he could think of and drove me out like a dog. I didn't know
what to do, or where to go, so I sauntered off to a nearby plantation
where a colored slave kept house for her bachelor slave owner and she
let me stay with her, and her boss drove me off after two days, because
I kept company with a nigger who worked for a man he didn't like. I was
barefooted, so I asked Moses Evans, to please buy me some shoes, my feet
was so sore and I didn't have no money nor no home neither. So he said
for me to wait till Saturday night and he'd buy me some shoes. Sure
'nough when Saturday night come, he buyed me some shoes, and
handkerchiefs and a pretty string of beads and got an old man neighbor
named Rochel to let me stay at his house. Den in a few weeks me and him
got married, and I was mighty glad to marry him to git a place to stay.
Yes I was. 'Cause I had said, hard times as I was having if I seed a man
walking with two sticks and he wanted me for a wife I'd marry him to git
a place to stay. Yes I did and I meant just dat. In all my born days I
never knowed of a white man giving a black man nothing, no I ain't.


"Now child, let me tell you right here, I was always a heap more scared
of dem Ku Klux dan I was of anything else. 'Cause de war was to help my
folks. But dem old Ku Klux never did mean us no good. Honey, I used to
make pallets on de floor after de war for my children, myself and
husband to sleep on, 'cause dem Ku Klux just come all around our house
at night time and shoot in de doors and windows. Dey never bothered
nobody in de day time. Den some time dey come on in de house, tear up
everything on de place, claim dey was looking for somebody, and tell us
dey hungry 'cause dey ain't had nothin' to eat since de battle of
Shiloh. Maybe twenty of 'em at a time make us cook up everything we got,
and dey had false pockets made in dere shirt, and take up de skillet
with de meat and hot grease piping hot and pour it every bit down de
front of dem shirts inside de false pockets and drop de hot bread right
down dere, behind de meat and go on.


"One night dey come to our house after my husband to kill him, and my
husband had a dream dey's coming to kill him. So he had a lot of colored
men friends to be at our house with guns dat night and time dey seed dem
Ku Klux coming over de hill, dey started shooting just up in de air and
about, and dem Ku Klux never did bother our house no more. I sure glad
of dat. I'se so tired of dem devils. If it hadn't been for dat dey would
have killed everyone of us dat night. I don't know how come dey was so
mean to us colored folks. We never did do nothing to dem.


"Dey go to some of dem niggers' house, and dey run up de chimney corner
to hide and dem low down hounds shoot 'em and kill 'em in de chimney
hole. Dey was terrible. Den de next bad thing happened to us poor
niggers after de war was dis. De white folks would pay niggers to lie to
de rest of us niggers to git der farming done for nothing. He'd tell us
come on and go with me, a man wants a gang of niggers to do some work
and he pay you like money growing on trees. Well we ain't had no money
and ain't use to none, so we glad to hear dat good news. We just up and
bundle up and go with this lying nigger. Dey carried us by de droves to
different parts of Alabama, Arkansas and Missouri. After we got to dese
places, dey put us all to work all right on dem great big farms. We all
light in and work like old horses, thinking now we making money and
going to git some of it, but we never did git a cent. We never did git
out of debt. We always git through with fine big crops and owed de white
man more dan we did when we started de crop, and got to stay to pay de
debt. It was awful. All over was like dat. Dem lying niggers caused all
dat. Yes dey did.


"I don't know what to think of this younger generation. 'Pears to me
like dey jest ain't no good. Dey is too trifling. I often times tell 'em
dere chances today side of mine in my day. Dey jest say dey wouldn't
take what I been through.


"But dey is just a hopeless lot, just plain no good. All I can say is as
you say, some is some good but so few 'ginst de masses, take so long to
find 'em, I just don't bother 'bout trying to hunt 'em out.


"I voted once in my life, but dat's been so long ago I don't 'member who
it was for, or where I was living at de time. I never had no friends in
politics to my knowing. All I 'member dey told me to put a cross under
de elephant, and I did dat. I don't know nothin 'more 'bout it dan dat.
Don't know what it meant or nothing. After all I been through, honest
chile, I love everybody in de world, dose dat mistreat me and dose dat
didn't. I don't hold nothing in my heart 'ginst nobody, no I don't. God
going to righten each wrong some day, so I'se going to wait with love in
my heart till dat day come. Den I speck I will feel plenty sorry, for
what's going to happen to dem dat mistreated me and my people and all
other helpless folks. 'Cause I seen white folks in my day, have 'bout as
tough time in a way as black folks, and right now some of 'em fairing
just 'bout like me.


"I 'member how de old slaves use to be workin' in de field singing 'Am I
born to die, And Lay Dis Body Down.' And dey sing, 'Dark was de night
and cold de ground, on which my lord was laid, Great drops of blood like
sweat run down, in agony He prayed.' Another song was 'Way over in de
promised land my Lord calls me and I must go'. And 'On Jordan's Stormy
Banks I stand, and cast a wishful eye. To Canaan's fair and happy land,
where my possessions lie. All o'er those wide extended plains, Shines
one eternal day; There God, the son forever reigns, And scatters night
away. No chilling winds, nor pois'nous breath, Can reach that healthful
shore; Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, Are felt and feared no more.
When shall I reach that happy place, And be forever blest? When shall I
see my father's face, And in his bosom rest? I am Bound for the Promised
Land.'

"Teresa Cannon wuz my mammy. She belonged to old Dr. Cannon, of Jackson;
when I was born. Tom Goings wuz my Daddy: He lived on a near-by
plantation. Mrs. Dunn bought my mammy and me. Den 'Massa' Lige Hill got
us fum her. I growed up out der near Whitewater. Dey wuz 'bout twenty
slaves on de place, 'en we wuz all living pretty good--plenty to eat,
an' clothes enuf. Dey wuzn't no school out dere, an' I didden know
nothin' 'bout readin' 'bout writin'--mostly, I jes' done 'chores'
carrin' in de wood 'en water en' sech like.


"I wuz 'bout ten years old wen de war wuz over, so I 'members well-nuf.
They wuz a battle over at White water, I didden see it, but I heard de
shooting and seed some o' de wounded men. De Southern soldiers had been
round de place for 'bout a week. 'Massa' had a grist mill 'en he had
lots o' corn. Dey wuz takin' our corn en' grindin' it for dey own use.
Dey wuz killin' our hogs, an' helpin' der selves to whut we had. Den
word came dat de 'Yankees' wuz comin'. 'Old George' was sent to take de
horses to de woods 'en hide 'em. Back in de woods he met two neighbor
boys, 'Willis' 'en 'Columbus Bain', en' dey showed him where to hide de
hosses, an' de sojers never did fin' 'em. Our young 'Massa Billie' 'en
de two 'Bain' boys got away--but de 'Yanks' druv de army clear to
Bloomfield 'en furder.


"De dead wuz laying all long de road an' dey stayed dere, too. In dem
days it wuzn't nuthin' to fin' a dead man in de woods. De 'Yankees' took
'Old Massa' 'en all de udder men in to Cape Girardeau 'en made 'um help
build de forte.


"We often seed sojers on de roads, but dey didden bother us much, but de
bushwackers, 'de wuz bad. One day, Bill Norman 'en his step-mother, fum
White water Station, cum up to our place. She had on a print dress 'en a
sunbonnet, 'en dat wuz all she had left in de world. Dey had burned up
everything for 'um--dey house, dey grist mill--everything. But sumtimes
de sojers got de Bushwackers--Dere wuz one fella named 'Bolen' dey got
him 'en tuck him to de Cape. Dere dey hung him on a high gate-post, jest
outside 'er town. My 'mammy', Teresa Cannon lived here in dis house wid
us for a long time. She died nine year ago at de age of one hundred 'en
fifteen."

"My full name wuz Rachael Exelina Mayberry (Mabrey) an' my mammy's name
was Cynthy Minerva Jane Logan. You see I carried de name Mayberry 'cause
dat wuz my masta's name. Masta' Josiah Mayberry. My mammy carried de
name Logan 'cause dat wuz de famly she belonged to fo' Masta' bought her
down in Buckskull, Arkansas. Masta had three sons, Dosh, his wife wuz
Roberta, Alf his wife wuz Malissa and Byrd, his wife wuz Cully. In dem
days we called 'em all by dere first name. We honored de ole Masta', but
de younger folks, we didden call Masta' Dosh, or Masta' Byrd--or Missus
Cully. It wuz jes Dosh, Byrd or Cully. I didden' know de ole Missus. Dey
tole me she went crazy and kilt herself shortly after I wuz borned
'cause she thought I was white. We wuz de only slave famly Masta' had en
he wuz good to us. We all liked him, all o' us but Cynthy, dat's my
mammy I allus called her Cynthy till after de war wuz over. Cynthy
always called him "Ole Damn"--she hated him 'cause he brought her fum
Arkansas and left her twins an' dey poppy down dere. Cynthy's daddy was
a full Cherrokee. She wuz always mad and had a mean look in her eye.
When she got her Indian up de white folks let her alone. She usta run
off to de woods till she git over it. One time she tuk me and went to de
woods an' it was nigh a month fore dey found her--and I wuz nigh dead.
Dey kept me at de white folks house till I got strong again. Only one
time Masta' whip me. We made lots o' molasses on our place. Oh! lots of
molasses en' dey wuz allus some barrels standin' upright wid bungs in
close to de bottom so de 'lasses run out. One day I seed one o' de men
fix him some sweetened tobaccy. He had his tobaccy in a box about so
big, en he push de bung des way, en dat way--den down, den up den he
hol' it jes loose enough so de 'lasses trickle out over his tobaccy. I
watched him an thought I'd fix me some, too. I got my box fixed en' I
pushed at de bung, I pushed dis way, en dat way like I seed him do when
all at once dat bung flew out en' dat lasses flew all over de place. De
barrel was full en' it cum out so fast I couldn't git de bung back in. I
tried till I wuz wadin' in 'lasses to my knees. Den I run call Masta'
and tell him a bung dun bust out. He say how you do dat? I tell him I
jes knock again' 'en it flew out. Den he seed my box and he knowed how I
done it. Den he laid me on de floor an' he put his foot on my haid. He
took his switch and he gave me one good out. Den he kept beatin on de
floor. I guess dat wuz to make de others think he wuz giving me a big
beatin'. But I didden want that big foot on my haid no more.


"De big house stood facing de road. It wuz built like lots o' houses wuz
in dem days, de kitchen and dinin' room on one side. Masta's room on de
udder with a big open hallway between. Across de front was a big porch.
We called it a gallery. Across de road, back a piece ways wuz our cabin.
Cynthy did all de cookin, an she wuz a good cook. We allus had plenty
good things to eat. De white folks would sit down en eat, en when dey's
through we'd sit down at de same table. I 'members de first shoes I ever
had. One of de men had got em fo' his little girl, en' dey was too
small. So he giv' 'em to my step-daddy for me. Dey uz too big but I wore
em en wuz proud of em. They wuz so big fo' me, they went dis way en' dat
way en' den de heels went all crooked. I wore 'em till 'bout de time de
first snow came den I guess I thought I'd wore 'em long enuf an' I
throwed em away. My step daddy whipped me for dat and made me wear 'em
all winter.


"I must a been 'bout eight year old when de war start. Fust I knowed,
one day Masta said to me. "Child go out to de gate an see if anyone
comin." I went to de gate like he tole me an' dere was men comin down de
road. Whew! I never seed so many men in all my life. I went back en'
tole him. He didden' say nuthin' but lit out the back way across the
fields an we didden see him again fo' some time.


"After that we saw lots o' sojers--dey'd stop at our place but dey never
bother nuthin. Masta told us allus to have plenty cookin' an bakin'
ready when de sojers came. Cynthy'd have de kitchen cupboard piled full
o' lightbread and cakes and pies--sometime dey's Rebel sojers an
sometimes dey's Republicans--We called de Northerns Republicans. We cud
allus tell 'em. The Rebels wore brown coats and the Northerners wore
blue suits wid pretty gold pieces on dey shoulders. My! but dey wuz
pretty.


"Masta' ud come home once en awhile--an den one day he come home--I can
see him yet a-sittin by de kitchen stove. De stove sat back in de big
fireplace far enuf so de pipe go up de flue but not too far so you could
look in de oven. Dere sat de Masta lookin' like he had sumthin' to tell
mammy but was skeered to. She had her mad up that day--I jes foun' a
hen's nest an' wuz runnin' in to tell her. I hollered "Cynthy,
Cynthy"--Masta' put up his hand en say, slow like--"Stop chile! You
mustin' call her Cynthy no more. The war is over and you no more slaves.
Now you must call her mammy". But dat all de difference it made--we kep'
on livin dere just de same, till Masta' died two year atter de war.


"One day a mule kicked him on de laig what wuz hurt in de war. It got so
bad de doctor couldn' do nuthin for it. Masta' wud holler wid pain--It
wuz in de fall of de year. One day I came in and sed, "Masta' you know
dat big yellow apple tree? It's bloomin again, en it's got little green
apples on it." He looked at me an sez--'Chile, youre lyin". I sez, "No
Masta I ain't." He say "If you're lyin' to me, I'll get up and lick you
again", so I runs and gets him a branch wid flowers on, and little green
apples, an when he sees it, he cries. He knows he's gonna die 'cause de
tree is bloomin out of season. But I didden know it. I says "Masta' if
dem apples gits ripe, we'll have good eatins''cause de big yellow mealy
ones wen dey fall, dey bust wide open."


"Masta' died en if I'd a know'd what I know now I could have saved him.
I'd a took young elder leaves en boiled em to make a tea--den I'd a
poured dat in de sore en it ud a got well.


"Masta' musta had hundreds a acres--'cause he give each o' his boys a
big farm--en dey was his dotter Caroline, by his fust wife--I forgit
'bout her--he give her a farm, too--Dis wuz down in Stoddard County,
near Advance. Shortly after dat Dosh died, en de rest sold out en' went
to Texas.


"We seed Masta' lots a times after he died. I sez it wuz Masta' 'cause
it looked like him. One day I was standin lookin thru de bars o' de gate
wen I seen out in de road de largest dog I ever seed in all my life. He
wuz standin' der lookin' at me. I says to my brother, 'Look! he's got
thick sandy red hair like Masta's, en he's got a nose like Masta's, en
he's got eyes like Masta's, an he sho' do look like Masta'--Den I run
back onto de gallery where de adder folks is. Dat dog stan' dere lookin
at us, de big brush on his tail jes a wavin', den he reach thru de gate
wid one paw, en onlatch it, and walked right in. The gate went shut agin
but it didden make no noise. Den he cum up de walk en go rite across de
gallery in front of us. He jump over de side fence, en run across de
field, en go inter de woods. We know'd it wuz Masta', jes cum to look
aroun, en it git so he'd cum every day 'bout noon, jes when Masta'
always cum in fo' dinner. We ain't never seed him cum outer de
graveyard, but he always com frum dat way. En one day I wuz playing in
de doorway of our cabin an I looked across to de big house, and dere sat
Masta' in his big chair on de gallery. I called Mammy en she says--'If
you're lyin', I'll whup you.' But she cum en look, en she seed him too,
he had his white shirt-sleeve rolled up to his elbow and his red flannel
undershirt sleeve down to his wrist jes like he uster wear it. Der he
sat en while we wus lookin he got up en walked off around the house.


"I 'members one evenin' 'bout dusk I wuz commin thru de cotton patch,
an' I run plum into a man crawlin' along--Dat wuz durin' de war, en der
he wuz crawlin' on his hands en knees. He had de biggest hands I ever
seed on a human, an his feet wasn't ever touchin de groun'--dey wuz jes
floppin' one over de udder, dis way. An his face!--I've seed false faces
but dis wuz de worst I ever seed--dere wuz big red en white stripes all
across his face. He rared up an looked at me like a dog rare on his
haunches, and jes' dat way he wuz taller dan I wuz. I didden stop to
look again' but I lit out en run through dat cotton patch. Lawd ha'
mercy! how I did run. I jes' knocked dat cotton one way er nother--en
dey didden whip me for it when I tole em 'bout it nuther. Nex' mornin'
we went down der to look, en we seed de tracks where his knees had
made--thru de cotton patch, cross the road, en enter de woods. But no
body else never did see him. I often studied, wuz he natchel, or jes a
ghost.


"When my little brother wuz borned, I 'members dat day. Mammy and I wuz
working out in dis corn patch. She wuz coverin' corn, an she jes had
'bout three or four more rows to cover, den she ran to de house. Dey wuz
jes one room en she tried to made de udder children go outside but dey
wouldn' go, so she ran outside in de chimney corner, en soon dey heard a
baby holler. Dey called me to cum quick 'cause Mammy found a baby. By de
spring house stood a ole tree--en I seed it had blown down an in de
branches was a big nest an de nest wuz empty. I sez--"Rite dere's where
mammy found her baby--rite outer dat nest". Dey sez, "No suh! She done
found it in de chimney corner, 'cause we heard it dere." No, mammy
didden need nobody to help tend to her. Aunt Hannah Erwin was a doctor
woman. She could sure cure a woman if she had child-bed fever--but my
mammy didden need her."

    "Which like a toad, ugly and venomous,
    "Wears yet a Jewel in its head."


    --Shakespeare.




Childhood and girlhood memories are vivid to Sarah Frances Shaw Graves,
an 87 year old Negro woman whose indomitable courage and steadfast
purpose overcame obstacles and made possible the ownership of the 120
acre farm near Skidmore, on R.F.D. #4, where she lives with her bachelor
son, Arza Alexander Graves.


The frame house which is their home, though small, is comfortable. It is
surrounded by a neatly kept yard, with flower beds and a cement walk
which leads from the gate to the front door.


The visit had been arranged by telephone, and as the interviewer neared
the home, Aunt Sally could be seen standing, on the front porch, eagerly
watching and waiting. A "close up" showed that her immaculately washed,
stiffly starched, print dress and apron were unwrinkled. Evidently she
had stood up ever since she had put them on.


Her white hair was combed back off her fore-head, and held in place by
side combs. Although age has lined her hands, and put deep furrows in
her brown cheeks, her unquenchable will to overcome handicaps has held
her body erect and shoulders undrooped. In spite of her years, most of
which were spent in gruelling labor, she is rugged and healthy, and
meets the world with a smile and ready sympathetic laughter.


She was eager to begin her story, and led the way into the house, where
at once the unmistakable signs of good housekeeping, cleanliness and
tasteful arrangement are apparent. The home, though small, is moderately
and comfortably furnished. They also enjoy the conveniences and
accommodations of the rural telephone, a radio and a daily newspaper.


Her life story is one of contrasts; contrasts of thought; contrasts of
culture, beneficial inventions and suffrage. Not far from her home the
glistening streamlined Zephyr speeds on twin rails beside the Missouri
River, near the route of the slow-moving, creaking wagons on the ox-road
of the 1850's.




[Illustration: _Sarah Frances Shaw Graves_]


Skidmore, Nodaway Co., Missouri.




"My name is Sarah Frances Shaw Graves, or Aunt Sally as everybody calls
me. Yes'm that's a lot of name an' I come by it like this. My husband
was owned by a man named Graves, and I was owned by a man named Shaw, so
when we was freed we took the surnames of our masters.


"I was born March 23, 1850 in Kentucky, somewhere near Louisville. I am
goin' on 88 years right now. (1937). I was brought to Missouri when I
was six months old, along with my mama, who was a slave owned by a man
named Shaw, who had allotted her to a man named Jimmie Graves, who came
to Missouri to live with his daughter Emily Graves Crowdes. I always
lived with Emily Crowdes."


The matter of allotment was confusing to the interviewer and Aunt Sally
endeavored to explain.


"Yes'm. Allotted? Yes'm. I'm goin' to explain that," she replied. "You
see there was slave traders in those days, jes' like you got horse and
mule an' auto traders now. They bought and sold slaves and hired 'em
out. Yes'm, rented 'em out. Allotted means somethin' like hired out. But
the slave never got no wages. That all went to the master. The man they
was allotted to paid the master."


"I never was sold. My mama was sold only once, but she was hired out
many times. Yes'm when a slave was allotted, somebody made a down
payment and gave a mortgage for the rest. A chattel mortgage."


A down payment!!


"Times don't change, just the merchandise.


"Allotments made a lot of grief for the slaves", Aunt Sally asserted.
"We left my papa in Kentucky, 'cause he was allotted to another man. My
papa never knew where my mama went, an' my mama never knew where papa
went." Aunt Sally paused a moment, then went on bitterly. "They never
wanted mama to know, 'cause they knowed she would never marry so long
she knew where he was. Our master wanted her to marry again and raise
more children to be slaves. They never wanted mama to know where papa
was, an' she never did", sighed Aunt Sally.


Only those who have lost their mate, and never know the end of the tale,
can understand such heart anguish.


"Mama said she would never marry again to have children," continued Aunt
Sally, "so she married my step-father, Trattle Barber, 'cause he was
sick an' could never be a father. He was so sick he couldn't work, so me
and mama had to work hard. We lived in a kitchen, a room in a log house
joined on to the master's house. My mama worked in the field, even when
I was a little baby. She would lay me down on a pallet near the fence
while she plowed the corn or worked in the field.


"Stepfather and mama often tended their own tobacco and grain in the
moonlight. This they could sell and have the money. We could go to
church which was held in the school house. Sometimes they let us play
with the other children after the noon dishes were washed and there
wasn't anything else to do.


"There was most always something to do. Master never allowed nobody to
be idle. Mama worked in the house and the fields too. At night after she
come home from the field, she had to grate corn for the family next day.
We didn't have many grist mills them days, an' we would punch holes in a
piece of tin, and rub the ear of corn across it and make meal for our
use.


"Nowadays, when you all want a nice wool dress, all you got to do is go
to the store and get it", Aunt Sally commented, when asked to tell about
their clothing.


"When I was growin' up an' wanted a nice wool dress, we would shear the
sheep, wash the wool, card it, spin it and weave it. If we wanted it
striped, we used two threads. We would color one by using herbs or
barks. Sometimes we had it carded at a mill, an' sometimes we carded it
ourselves. But when we did it, the threads were short, which caused us
to have to tie the thread often, makin' too many knots in the dress. I
have gathered the wool off the fences where it had been caught off the
sheep, an' washed it, an' used it to make mittens.


"Yes'm. I worked in the fields, and I worked hard too. Plantin' and
harvestin' in those days was really work. They used oxen to break up the
ground for corn, an' for plowin' it too. They hoed the corn with a hoe,
and cut the stalks with a hoe and shocked 'em. They cut the grain with
the cradle and bound it with their hands, and shocked it. They threshed
the grain with a hickory stick. Beating it out.


"I carried water for the field hands. I've carried three big buckets of
water from one field to another, from one place to another; one in each
hand and one balanced on my head.


"Yes'm. Some masters was good an' some was bad. My mama's master whipped
his slaves for pastime. My master was not so bad as some was to their
slaves. I've had many a whippin', some I deserved, an' some I got for
being blamed for doin' things the master's children did. My master
whipped his slaves with a cat-o'-nine-tails. He'd say to me, 'You ain't
had a curryin' down for some time. Come here!!!' Then he whipped me with
the cat. The cat was made of nine strips of leather fastened onto the
end of a whip. Lots of times when he hit me, the cat left nine stripes
of blood on my back. Yes ma'am."


Aunt Sally brooded over the whipping memories, then under the influence
of a brighter thought continued:--


"I belong to the African Methodist Episcopal Church, an' I ain't never
cussed but once in my life, an' that was one time I nearly got two
whippin's for somethin' I didn't do. Some of master's kin folks had a
weddin', an' we walked to the church, an' somebody kicked dust on the
bride's clothes, an' I got blamed but I ain't never kicked it. The
master's daughter Puss, she kicked it. Ole mistress she whipped me.
Yes'm, she whipped me. It was the worst whippin' I ever got. The worst
whippin' in my whole life, an' I still got the marks on my body. Yes'm.
I got 'em yet.


"When the master come home, he was goin' to whip me again, an' I got
mad, an' told him it was a lie, an' if Puss said I kicked dust on the
white folks she was a DAMNED LYIN' DEVIL. He took the switch an' gave
Puss a whippin' for tellin' a lie. Yes'm. That's the only time I ever
cussed in my life.


"Yes'm, an' that's about all I knows about slavery and folks ways
hereabouts. I can tell you about after we was freed. When we was freed
all the money my mama had was 50 cents. I never went to school till
after I was freed. I went two winters and a little more to school near
Burlington Junction. I never went a full term 'cause I had to work.


"I knowed my husband all my life. He was brought here by that man Jimmie
Graves, that mama was allotted to. My husband took that name. His full
name was Joseph H. Graves. We had one child, a boy. His name is Arza
Alexander Graves. He lives here with me. It's our farm.


"I have lived on this place ever since I was married. That was in the
same year that Burlington Junction was started. We first bought 40 acres
for $10.00, then two years later we bought the back 80 acres for $15.00.
Things is changed. We workin' for ourself now, an' what we get is our'n,
an' no more whippin's. I worked in the fields and helped pay for this
land. I belong to the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Maryville."


The day her family was freed, they had 50 cents. Today these children of
a transplanted race, once enslaved, have through years of steadfast
courage overcome the handicap of race and poverty. They threshed grain
with a hickory stick, and made their corn meal by grating the ears
across a strip of tin with holes punched in it.


With all her handicaps, this Negro woman has lived to an honorable old
age, is self-supporting and has the respect of her neighbors. All this
she has accomplished despite the fact she was once a chattel and was
frequently "curried down" with a "cat-o'-nine-tails."


    *Interview with Sarah Frances Shaw Graves,*
    *R.F.D. #4, Skidmore, Missouri.*


Sarah Frances Shaw Graves (Aunt Sally) whose address is R.F.D. #4
Skidmore, Missouri is eighty-seven years of age. She lives with her
bachelor son on their one-hundred-twenty acre farm. The home though
small is moderately furnished and she enjoys the comforts of the rural
telephone and radio and daily newspapers in her home. The house is
surrounded by a nice yard containing many flowers and is enclosed with
an iron fence, a cement walk leading from the front gate to the house.


Aunt Sally had been informed that the reporter was intending to call on
her the following day and she was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the
visitor. The reporter was greatly impressed by the arrangement and
cleanliness of Aunt Sally's modest home. Aunt Sally was immaculately
dressed in a stiffly starched print dress and a fresh white apron. Her
white hair was combed straight back off her forehead and held back with
side combs. She was in a very excited talkative mood, and talked freely,
and laughed heartily when the reporter explained the purpose of the
interview and asked the privilege of taking her picture. Actual
interview follows:


"My name is Sarah Frances Shaw Graves or Aunt Sally as everybody calls
me. I am eighty-seven (87) years old and I was born March 23, 1850 in
Kentucky somewhere near Louisville. I was brought to Missouri when I was
six months old with my Mamma who was a slave owned by a man named Shaw
who had allotted her to a man named Jimmie Graves who came to Missouri
to live with his daughter. Emily Graves Crowdes. I always lived with
Emily Crowdes. We left my Papa in Kentucky as he belonged to another
man. My Papa never knew where my Mamma and me went and my Mama and me
never knew where my Papa went. They never wanted Mama to know where my
Papa was because they knew Mama would never marry as long as she knew
where he was. Our Master wanted Mama to marry again and raise more
children for slaves but Mama said she would never marry a man and have
children so she married my step-father, Trattle Barber, because she knew
he had a disease and could not be a father. He was sick and not able to
work so me and Mama had to work hard. We lived in a kitchen, a room in a
log house joined on to the Masters house. All I knew about that part was
what they told me. The Crowdes family who we came here with, settled
near Possum Walk which is near the place that is now called Burlington
Jct., Missouri. We were freed in 1863 but we heard so much about slavery
coming back that we stayed with the Crowdes' two years longer or until
1865 when we was sure that we was freed. When we was freed we took the
same name as our Masters. We then lived about two miles north of them
and worked for some of the neighbors who was poor and had children and
we lived on Lowell Livengood's grandfather's place for about two years.
Mamma had fifty (50c) cents coming to her and that is all the money we
had. My Mama did a washing for that money for a lady and the Mistress
told her that when the lady called for her washing that the fifty cents
belonged to us. This was after we was freed. I went to school near
Burlington Jct., Missouri and my teacher's name was Rachel Libbey. I
went to school two winters a little while, I never went a full term any
time. I had to work and when the busiest time was over I would go to
school when I didn't work. I knew my husband all my life. He was owned
by this man Jimmie Graves who Mama was alotted to, but was brought here
by the man he was alloted to, named Nicholas. My husband's full name was
Joe H. Graves. We had one child, a boy, whose name is Arza Alexander
Graves. I have lived on this place I am on now every since I was
married, that was the same year Burlington Jct., Missouri, started. We
first bought forty (40) acres and paid twenty ($20.00) dollars for that,
then about two years later we bought the back eighty (80) acres and I
think we paid fifteen ($15.00) dollars for that. I worked in the fields
and helped pay for this land. I belong to the African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Maryville, Missouri.


"When I was growing up and wanted a nice wool dress we would shear the
sheep, wash the wool, card it, spin it, and weave it. If we wanted it
striped we used two threads, we would color one by using herbs and
barks. We sometimes had it carded at a mill and sometimes we carded it
ourselves but when we did it the threads were short which caused us to
have to tie the thread often making more knots in the dress. In planting
corn in them days they broke up the ground, one layed off the rows, one
would go along and drop the corn or grain and if they wanted to plant
beans in with the corn one would go along and drop the seed. They
covered it over with a hoe and they cut the stalks with the hoe and
stacked up the stalks. The way they raised the corn after it came up
they took one horse and went on each side of a row and in the middle of
every row to plow the corn. It took three rounds on every row to get it
plowed. They used oxen sometimes to plow and nearly always used oxen to
plow up the ground. They cut the grain with the cradle and bound it with
their hands and shocked it up. They thrashed the grain with a hickory
stick by beating it out. Many times I have carried three big buckets of
water from one place to another, one in each hand and one balanced on my
head. My Master was not as bad as some Masters was to their slaves. One
time when I had over worked my Master said, "You have not had a currying
down for a long time, come over here," and he whipped me with a
cat-o'-nine-tails. This cat was made of nine small pieces of leather
fastened on to the end of the whip. Lots of times when they hit with the
cat it left nine stripes of blood. Mama's Master whipped his slaves for
past-time. I have got many whippings for being blamed for doing things
the Master's children did and I was blamed for it. One time when a
couple was married, me and other members of the family were walking down
the road and I was very careful not to kick up any dirt and to be very
nice to the couple but when we got home one of the Master's daughters
told that I was mean and that I kicked up dirt so that dust would get on
the lady's dress and I got the worst whipping I ever got in my life by
the Mistress and I still have the marks on my body, and when the Master
came I was carrying the vitales from the kitchen to the dining room
which was the living and bed room and when I went in I took the bread
and when I came back he was standing in the door and he told me what
they told him about me and I said I did not do it and if "Puss" said I
did she is a "Damned lying devil" and he dropped the switch and went and
talked to his daughter and gave her a whipping for telling the untruth.
That was the only time I ever swore. In a few days the bride came over
visiting and told them they had the sweetest little colored girl she was
so lovely and kind. We were never allowed to be idle, always doing
something and my work often was choring around to say I was doing
something. I have gathered the wool off the fences where it had been
caught off the sheep and washed it and used it to make mittens. I never
was sold and my Mama was sold only once but she was hired out many
times. We slept on what they called a bed, a tick filled with straw on
the bed. My Mama's Master had a child near my age and my Mama always
left me at the house with the Mistress and I nursed the Mistress, Mrs.
Crowdes, as well as her own child until one day the curtain, which was
used as a partition around a bed on which I lay near, caught on fire and
then my Mama always took me to the field with her and would lay me on a
pallet near the fence while she plowed the corn or worked in the field.
Stepfather and Mama often tended to their own tobacco and grain in the
moonlight which they could sell and have the money. One thing we could
go to church which was held in the school house. Sometimes they would
let me go out and play with the other children after the noon dishes
were washed and there wasn't anything else to do then. I often sewed
strips of cloth together to make carpet rags, there was always something
to do. Mama worked in the field and in the house too. They nearly always
kept a girl in the house. We did not have many mills and sometimes we
could not get to the mill and we would punch holes in a piece of tin and
rub the ear of corn across it to grate it for our use. Many times Mama
would work in the field all day and in the evening she would grate
enough corn for the family use the next day. The Masters had stores and
you had to go to that store and get your needs and when the month was up
you had nothing as it took all you earned to pay your bill."

"We seed lotsa sojers cum by durin' de war, but dey nebber bothered us

    *Interview with Mrs. Lou Griffin,*
    *St. Louis, Missouri.*


Mrs. Lou Griffin, a daughter of Minnie and William Gibson, is something
over ninety years old. She does not know her exact age. She tells the
writer she is one of a family of thirteen children and that her
grandmother had twenty-one children. She lives with a great nephew at
2935 Easton Avenue, St. Louis. She tells her story as follows:


"People tells me not to tell nothing 'bout myself to folks like you what
asks me, 'cause you ain't going to give me nothing for it nohow, but
somebody somewhere pays you to gather up this stuff. So I's just gonna
tell you dis much, sister. Sure 'nough I was slave born. 'Fore I was big
enough to do nothing us chillun used to run about in de woods while de
old folks was working on de plantation. We git stole away by white folks
what wasn't our owners and sold I reckon, nobody knowed where de chillun
gone nor who got 'em. We know dis much, we didn't never see 'em any
more.


"We just be out in de woods picking fruit and flowers. I know this
though, sister, after while, de Rebels got a heap of us. I heard 'em say
dey some times get fifty dollars for some of de black folks dey sold and
some big healthy ones brought one-hundred dollars. Course I don't know
how much money dey brought, I just know 'bout it. We use to go to de
church house. If we suited de overseer he let us go. If we didn't we got
lashed plenty. Dey lash you till you was forced to pray den dey whip you
like anything for prayin'. But God done stopped all that now. Dis heah
old Abe Lincoln come through our town. I guess you done heard 'bout him,
is you, honey? If you ain't, I'll tell you. He just come 'round to see
how de Rebs do de slaves. I gets so full thinkin' how de good Lawd fix
it for us. He come 'round when nobody's lookin' for him. Bye and bye he
says, fight for your freedom in de Yankee army instead of standing
'round here being sold and treated like beasts.


"Ole Jeff Davis was a Rebel and he rode a fine horse. Abe Lincoln come
there, wid a mule. De slaves made up a song 'bout how old Abe Lincoln
got hold of Jeff Davis in de army and Abe Lincoln took and rode Jeff
Davis' big fine horse and Jeff Davis had to ride de mule. Abe Lincoln
was United States president and Jeff Davis was de fool. We often hear
tell of dem Yankees coming to our town a long time 'fore dey get there.
We know when dey reached us, 'cause dey run dem Rebs way from their own
place and take 'em themselves. I been all down in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina and everywhere, being hiked around by dem
Valentines, dat's de name of my mother's owners and mine too, for that.
I 'haved so I didn't git licked like some more did, yes indeed I did. De
bells would ring for day, sissy, and we had to get up and start right in
working, yes mam. I use to love to see 'em drill dem soldiers. Sure did.
I thank God it is all over now. I ain't going to tell you no more. Like
to have you stay awhile, but if you want just come back."

    _Never Sold His Vote_


"I is 90 years old and was born right dere in Whittenburg, Cape
Girardeau County, Missouri, across de creek. We was stayin' with
Greenvilles den. My father was named Nathan and my mother was Mary. She
died right after de war was over. My grandmother was born in West
Virginia and I had three brothers and three sisters. Dey is all dead but
me. My father drove an old ox team around dere hauling coal. He fought
in de war and come back and went right to work and den bought him a farm
back of Whittenburg and lived dere until he died.


"De first work I done was on de farm. Den I worked at Mine la Motte, and
Buck Eye. Was a tie inspector and also worked in de car shop at Madison,
Illinois. On de farm I got $1 a day. In de mines I got $12 a week. In de
car shop I made about 40 cents a hour. I bought dis property here with
my money and have been on it for 18 years. I give $450 for dis property.
I've paid $11 taxes for eight or nine years and now pay $5 a year. De
master had a big farm of two or three hundred acres and had four or five
slaves. Sometimes my father would take me down dere in de woods to a
white picnic. After my father's first wife died he did not let us run
around much. We used to fight with de white kids but had no trouble with
de old folks. At Christmas time, man dey treated us with fun; eats of
all kinds, dat you could pack home.


"When de war was over we moved across de creek to ourselves and my
father bought 25 or 30 acres. I felt like a new man when de war was
over. I stayed with my grandfather until I was 21 and got married in
Perry County when I was 32. I had 4 children and dey is all dead. My
wife has been dead about 14 years. I've lived 25 years in Fredericktown.
De young Negroes ain't no account as compared to when I was a boy. De
parents nowadays don't make dem work hard enough. Dey can sleep all day
if dey want to. Some of de young Negroes around here work in de shoe
factory. Some load ties.


"Once when I was a baby, my sister was sitting by de fireplace rocking
me and she fell asleep and let me fall in de fireplace and I was burned
on de hand. Four of my fingers was burned and have never come out
straight. When I was a boy I did not know what a stove looked like. We
had dese old corded beds. Dere used to be a lot of wild hogs around dere
and dey would eat anything dey got hold of. We would put up ice from de
Mississippi River. It was over a foot thick. We wore home-made clothes
and did not buy no clothes. We wore copper-toed shoes called brogans. De
first time I voted was for Teddy Roosevelt. I been voting ever since.
Lots of dem have told me how to vote but I never sold my vote."








Fil Hancock




    *Interview with Fil Hancock,*
    *Rolla, Missouri.*


    _"Uncle" Fil Hancock_


The following interview, bristling with facts and vivid recollections
covering more than three quarters of a century was obtained recently by
a worker employed by the Federal Writers' Project in Missouri from
"Uncle" Fil Hancock, eighty-six year old Negro, living at Rolla,
Missouri. The old man's story, told as nearly as possible in his own
dialect runs thus:


"I was born 1851, de 28th day of February. My granny come here with her
missus-Hancock--when dey brung de Cherokee Indian tribe here from
middlin' Tennessee, de time dey moved de Missouri Indians back to
Oklahoma, what dey called Indian Territory way back 'bout 135 or 140
years ago. Our old missus maiden name was Riggs. My old master was
Scotch-Irish. A big, red faced man wid sandy hair, mostly baldheaded. Us
little niggers was scairt of him and run and hid when we see him coming.
He weren't 'lowed to whip us, 'cause he didn't own us. Our old missus
had eleven of us and he had twenty-one niggers of his own. And our old
missus wouldn't let him tech us.


"We had to mind him though. But she done de whipping. My own mammy
whipped us good and proper--She used a razor strop, and shore poured it
on us. She was puny and sick most all de time. Dey said she had
consumption, now-days dey calls it T.B. But it was plain old consumption
in dem days. I 'member, she were so sick dat she were not able to hold
us an' whip us, and she made one of us little niggers push de other one
up to her bed while she whipped us. We took our turns in gittin' a
whipping. Poor old mammy, she loved us and wanted us to do right. We
never got a whipping 'ceptin' we needed it. Old granny, my mammy's
mother and old missus whipped us a little, an only wid buckbresh, jes' a
little 'roun' de ankles. All us little niggers was jes' like stairsteps,
one after de other. I got whipped plenty, but I needed it.


"My ol' missus Hancock named me herself--called me Filmore Taylor
Hancock, after two presidents who took der seats in 1850. Ol' Colonel
Hancock was our master an' he was de richest man in Greene County,
Missouri, and owned more slaves than any man in Missouri. His wife, old
missus was born in 1804. My own granny on my mammy's side was born in
1805. My granny was given to missus, as her own de day she was born.
'Course old missus was only a year old den. Der was thirty-two of us
slaves on our old missus place, and eleven of us sprung from old granny.


"We had five young missus. My young missus names were Winnie, Elizabeth,
Lucinda, Luella, and Tennessee. Dey was so rich and proud, dey wouldn't
look at any body to marry. Only two of 'em ever married. Dey was fine
ladies, but dey shore had me plumb spilt. Some of dem whipped me three
or four times, but I 'member how dey jes' breshed me a little roun' de
legs, and turn away and laugh a little. I can see now I needed more'n I
got. If I told a lie I got whipped for it, and old missus poured it on
if we lied.


"I and de other two gals, my sisters and a brudder of mine--well, when
our mammy died, old missus took us down to her house, away from our
cabin, so she could look after us. Our old granny was de white folk's
cook. She helped look after us. We got to eat what de white folk did. Up
to de cabins where de other niggers was, had salt meat, cabbage,
'taters, and shortnin' bread three times a day. We all had plenty
vegetables we raised ourselves. Every Sunday mornin' our missus sent us
up a big tray 'bout three feet long, made of sycamore--and it full of
flour. Once a week we had hot biscuits. But me and Squire, my brudder
and my sisses, Mary and Margot had it a little better, we had what our
old missus had. I was ten years an' six months old when de war come up.


"In '61, I see General Lyons, when he passed right by our house. All de
Union sojers had to pass by our house time of de war. We lived on the
main wagon road from Rolla to Springfield. Well child, Lordy me! dat's
funny for me to tell you how General Lyon look. It was a sight to see
him with them 'purties'! And we asked old missus what dat was, them
'purties' he had on his shoulders. She says to us chillun: 'He is de
general. All dem odder men got to mind him'. He was killed in dat battle
of Wilson Creek. Dey kept him in an icehouse in a spring, owned by a man
named Phelps. He lived west of Springfield. Dey keep General Lyon two
weeks, 'fore they brung him down dis-a-way. Dey shipped him out of Rolla
to Connecticut--dat's what I hear de ol folks says. Dat man Phelps was
our neighbor and later he got to be governor of Missouri in 1876.
Crittenden was first de Democratic governor in '73.


"Old missus called us little darkies all up--and carried us down to de
wagon General Lyon's body was in, when dey was bringin' him back here.
And we looked at him and asked what was de matter. Old missus said 'He
was killed.' He was packed in ice in de wagon and de wagon had four
mules hitched to it. I wanted to know if he was de man who had dem
'purties' on his shoulders. She said 'Yes'.


"I said, 'Did marse Bill and marse George and marse Jeff Hancock hep
kill him?' She said: 'Yes'. Marse Bill, marse George an' marse Jeff was
my young bosses, my old master's sons. Old missus didn't seem glad or
anything, jes' looked kinda sad. We asked her would he ever fight again.
She said, 'No'. I won't ever forget how General Lyon looked. He rode a
kinda gray-white horse when I first see him and looked so tall and proud
like.


"De rebels held Springfield from 1861 till 1862, when General Freemont
come in and took it. Marmaduke and Price had de biggest armies of de
southerners, Freemont come sneaking in, wrapped his wagon wheels with
old blankets so dey wouldn't hear him coming, and he had a body guard of
three hundred. Marmaduke and Price was den in Springfield. Freemont come
'bout daybreak, and started shooting de town up. He got de town and held
it.


"Marmaduke and Price drifted 'round to de Southeast part of de State and
went into Arkansas. Later dey had a three hour scrummage at Pea Ridge,
Arkansas. Either 62 or 63, I kaint 'member much, I was too little and
scairt to know. Being only ten or eleven years old. Dey was a man named
Finis McCrae, a rebel in de Marmaduke and Price Army, in de infantry. He
took sick some place in Arkansas. Dey brung him to us, we being rebels,
and keep him two weeks in our up-stairs, not letting any one know he was
dere. We kept him till he got better and he went back into de army and
fit some more.


"I seen Marmaduke in person, when he was making his campaign for
governor, down in Cuba, Missouri. All de Union sojers stopped at our
house to get water. We had a runnin' stream that never did go dry. They
filled their canteens there. All us chillun fussed 'bout 'em takin' our
milk and butter outen de spring-house. Old missus keep all her milk and
butter and cheese in dere to keep it cool. When de Union sojers come by
our house to Rolla dey took so much of de water to fill dere canteens it
nearly took our spring dry. Took every thing we had in de
spring-house--milk, butter--everything.


"I don't 'member how dey was dressed, but dey all had on sumpin' blue.
Uniforms I guess. Me and four more little darkies was one-half mile
offen de big road when dey passed, and got scared and run back to old
missus house and hid in de old barn loft all dat night. Old missus asked
us what we did for sumpin' to eat. We told her we bent de rye down in de
field and rubbed de grain out wid our hands and eat dat. She took us to
de house and give us sompin' to eat. De sojers was still passing de
house den.


"In time of de Civil War we wouldn't come down to Rolla, we went south
to do our trading. We wasn't Union and Rolla was Union Headquarters. Old
Master was getting old den, he had been a colonel in some army or other
way 'fore de Civil War.


"Lincoln issued 'green backs' 'long 'bout '61 or '62, after Stephen A.
Douglas goes up to Washington and tell Lincoln, after he got de
'nomination dat if he didn't get Jeff Davis and some of de leaders and
prosecute 'em, he was going to have war on his hands. Lincoln tells
Douglas to go back and tell Jeff Davis to lay dem guns down, dat in 90
days he would 'low dem so much a head for dere niggers. Dat if dey would
free dem dey could be paid for so much a head, by taxation. But Lincoln
told dem dey would all have to come back together again same as before
like dey was. You see dese folks in de south had done got $8,000,000,
all dat ammunition and guns and things from England. Jeff Davis and dem
leaders wouldn't give it up.


"De first issue of greenbacks was $175,000,000 and de next issue was
$250,000,000. We had been told all dis and I ask old missus if she
reckon we could whip dem 'blue bellied yankees'. I says: 'Dey ain't got
no money'.


"We called de Union sojers--'Yankees' and our side was called de Gray or
de Rebels. It's 75 years, the 10th day of August, 1937, that General
Lyon was killed.


"My boss--Hancock was de biggest slave holder in Missouri when de war
first come up. He settled four miles east of Springfield, Missouri. He
owned close to 1200 or 1500 acres of ground. From Springfield to
Strafford--east. We had 375 acres in cultivation--corn, oats, wheat,
rye, and clover was our main crops.


"My daddy belonged to a man named Lou Langston. There is a railroad
station named for this same Langston. What was known as the 'Gulf Road.'
I took my mammy's white folk's name. They were as fine and good as
anybody. The first child old missus had was a boy, Bill Hancock. The
first child my old granny had (on my mammy's side) was a boy, named Joe.
Old missus gave granny's boy Joe, to her boy Bill, as a slave. You see
my old missus and my old granny was born a year apart demselves.


"One time my old master Hancock, got mad at my uncle, who was a growed
up nigger. Old marse wanted to whip him. He tried to make my uncle put
his head twixt his (old marser's) knees. My uncle didn't offer to fight
him, but twisted him roun' and roun' trying to get his head out. He gave
one twist dat throwed old marse down to de ground. My uncle jumped and
run and jumped over de fence. My uncle did not belong to old marse but
to his son, Bill. But old marse sure got mad when my uncle run. So he
sold him to a man named Dokes--a nigger trader of dat neighborhood.
Dokes bought niggers and sold dem on de block in St. Louis. When Dokes
took my uncle away, one of our neighbors by de name of Fisher--up near
Strafford, gits on his horse and goes to Springfield and tells my young
boss, Bill, dat old man Hancock had sold Joe and Jane. Jane belonged to
Marse Hancock. Mister Fisher had only one colored man, and he told my
young boss, Bill, dat if he would buy both them niggers back, dat he
would buy Jane for his (Fisher's) colored man. He didn't have no woman
for him.


"Old Dokes was on his way den to St. Louis with 'em. Bill and Fisher
started out, rode and caught up with dem near what is now known as Knob
View, Missouri. When dey come in sight of Dokes, Bill stopped and
dropped back. Fisher goes up to de wagon, stopped Dokes and asked him
what he would take for Joe and Jane. They was settin' up in the wagon
handcuffed together. I think it was a thousand dollars or fifteen
hundred dollars he asked for both. Den Fisher beckoned to Bill Hancock
to come on. Bill come up and paid Dokes what he asked. Dokes was to take
'em back, hisself, to dere own neighborhood.


"When marse Bill rode up, my uncle said, 'Take these handcuffs off me'.
Mr. Dokes took them off. My uncle jumped out of de wagon and run up to
de big mule my young boss was settin' on, he reached up an' took Bill,
his marster off dat mule so quick and lay him down on de ground. He
commenced to love and kiss him on side of his head. He picked him up and
sat marse Bill on his mule again and said, 'I know marse Bill wasn't
goin' to let me be sold.' He takes him off his mule again and lay him
down two times more and keep lovin' and kissin' him, he was dat happy.


"But old marse Hancock, jes' wouldn't let Joe live on his place again,
no more. He was dat mad. It made him so mad to think Joe had turn him
over when he had his legs twixt his knees. But young marse Bill took Joe
to Springfield and hired him out to a blacksmith by de name of Lehr. He
got forty dollars a month for him. Joe stayed dere till de Civil War.
Old master let Joe come to de house to see his mother, my old granny,
once in a while, but never to live.


"Old man Fisher bought de colored woman from marse Bill, for his colored
man, and paid him as he could. Our white folks had plenty of money to
get any thing they wanted.


"I first come to Rolla in 1869 and stayed till 1870. Then dere was only
one brick house in Rolla, standin' where the Edwin Long Hotel now
stands. Den I left and went to Cuba and stayed dere and at Salem til'
1882. I come back to Rolla when de Crandel House was built, where de
Rolla Hospital now is located. I started a barber shop here under the
Crandel House basement. I have been here and at Salem ever since 1882,
Rolla my headquarters.


"If I can leave enough when I die, I want to be buried at the Union
Graveyard in Greene County, Missouri, where my mammy is buried since
three years before the Civil War. My daddy was buried there in 1863.


"When I was young, we didn't know nuthin' 'bout churches. Us kids never
got to go no place 'less de old niggers took us. And dey wouldn't take
us. De older ones had church out in de brash, under de shade trees.


"I kin 'member one of my cousins carryin' me pick-a-back, one time,
three miles to church. Dey only had church in de summer time, or meeting
dey called it. It was allus in de woods. We dassen't be ketched wid a
book to read or to try to be educated. Course every one wasn't treated
dat-a-way. Sometimes de niggers would have dancin', if de bosses or
masters gave dem passes. De passes read sumpin' like dis: 'Let my nigger
file pass and repass to such and such a place'.


"I 'member once, my missus bought me a pair of high top red boots. My! I
was proud. In dem days, we went barefoot most all year round. But my
missus tried to make us happy on Christmas. I put dem boots on and I
pranced round and round jes' to hear dem squeak. I done thought dat was
de purtiest noise I ever heard. I asked old missus, could I go to old
Massy's house. He were our neighbor, 'bout half mile--but it were dark.
Old missus said, 'Hain't you scared to go?' I say, 'No'. I went up de
road, my boots squeaking and squeaking. Didn't have time to be
scared--listenin' to dem boots.


"Aunt Rachel, my own aunt, lived at Massy's house. You see Masseys was
dere name and dey was white folks but we say Massy's house. I wanted my
old aunt to see my new boots. When I got dere I called my aunt to come
see my boots. She come and say, 'Hain't you scared to come here all
'lone'. I say, 'no'. I twisted and turn, round and round so she could
hear 'em squeak. But when it come time to go home, I got plum' scared.
Aunt Rachel had to take me. She took me where I could see our house. My!
How old missus laughed when she found I had to be brung home. She say,
'I told you, you be scared to come alone'.


"In dem days no nigger got boots till he was big and able to work for
'em. I was old missus pet and she plum' spilt me. I allus got more'n de
odder niggers got. Boys had cotton shirts and de gals had cotton
dresses.


"You know it's a funny thing, de white folks took everything from us
niggers, even try to take our old songs and have dem on de radio. We
niggers say 'De white folks take everything, dis, dat, an' t'other, but
what we got is jes' natural borned to us.'


"I knocks a tamborine jes' like de Georgia niggers played a tambourine,
'fore de Civil War. Dem Georgia minstrels was taken over to England to
perform 'fore de Queen Victoria, way 'fore Civil War. Folks from way up
East got 'em and took 'em. Dey ain't many plays like dem no more."


"Uncle" Fil, as he was familiarly known in Rolla, played for the Folk
Festival in Rolla and received so much applause, he had to be helped off
the stage. He is exceedingly active. He plays the old tambourine, (he
owned so many years) under and over his legs, behind his head, bouncing
it and catching it, never losing the rhythm an instant.


He is tall and erect, and has a remarkable memory, especially for dates,
names and places. He loves children, and usually has a pocket full of
pennies for the babies. His home is a one-room hut (plain shed building)
back of the Post Office on Ninth Street, Rolla, Missouri. He lives alone
and has no living relatives. The people of Rolla aid him with gifts.


Uncle "Fil's" favorite old spiritual is below. He says: "Dis song, I'm a
tellin' you, is de truf."


    Dis Is My Buryin' Groun'


    Ask my Lord for mercy,
    Good Lord, gimme religion,
    Good Lord, gimme me a heart to b'lieve,
    Dis is de buryin' groun'.
    Amen, Hallelujah. Dis is de buryin' groun'.


    Tell your mother,
    Tell your father,
    Dis is de buryin' groun',
    Tell all your neighbors,
    Tell all your neighbors chillun,
    Dis is de buryin' groun'.


Uncle Fil says, "Niggers jes' makes dey own verses, jes' naturally comes
to us, and we make our own rhyme as we go."


One of the humorous songs, a favorite of his, goes:


    You, by word, now all we go,
    In fact we spoke both high and low,
    In the house and out of doors,
    Ebening in the baby's nose.
    When I was young an' in my prime,
    I'se a countin' courtin' them gals,
    Most all de time.
    Now I'm old and you will see,
    I'm not as young as I used to be.
    Now when the elephant moves aroun'
    The music begins to play,
    Oh, the boys aroun' dat monkey's cage
    I'd better keep away.
    Rock the cradle John,
    Rock the cradle John,
    Many a man is rockin' another man's son
    When he thinks he's rockin' his own.

    *Interview with Dave Harper,*
    *Montgomery City, Missouri.*


    _Dave Is Cardinal Fan_


Dave Harper, a former slave, had just tuned in on the baseball game when
the interviewer arrived for he is an ardent Cardinal fan and, although
he was extremely courteous, he never missed a play in that game. He was
not at all reticent about telling of his life though plainly curious to
know the purpose of the interview and just a bit skeptical as to its
final use. Dave, who now lives in Montgomery City, Mo., has been a
gardener for years, always having the earliest and finest vegetables as
well as supplying others with plants for resetting.


"I'll be glad to tell you anything I remember," Dave said in reply to
the request for something of his life story. "Col. Harper was my master.
We lived northwest of town (Montgomery City). I was born in Montgomery
County and lived dere all my life. Col. Harper had 25 or 30 slaves; dere
was lots of money wrapped up in dem."


Here Dave reflected for a moment and shook his head sadly at the amount
of cash invested in humans and then continued.


"He bought me when I was six years old. I was born eighty-seven years
ago next January, down on Clear Fork, southwest of Danville, near
Mineola, 'bout half mile from Capt. Callaway's grave. No'm, it don't
seem like dey could have found enough dirt dere to cover his body. It
sure is rocky dere. Did you ever read Nat Sharp's history? It says dat
one of Capt. Callaway's men was buried down dere across de field.


"I've seen slaves go through Danville in droves like cattle. Dey was
chained together and dey walked 'em to St. Louis to de nigger yard. One
mother give out. De man in charge made her give her baby away, she
couldn't carry it no further. Someone near Danville raised de baby.


"I was sold when I was six years old to Clark Whitesides's father to
nurse Clark. My mother was sold down on de Missouri River. I'll tell you
'bout dat. De Fords moved to Danville from Virginia. Dere was several
brothers in together in de nigger business. Dey brought my mother to
wait on Mrs. Ford and carry her her coffee. She married and had three
children. De nigger traders from Virginia run an attachment to get
possession of my mother. Den on de way back he took cholera and died. De
case was in court when de war come up. Mr. Ben Sharp had de money, he
died and dat ended it. I was sold by Thos. J. Powell, de sheriff. Mother
was to be sold. Kit Talbot bid on her and de baby. She cried so hard
'cause she wanted to live with me dat Dr. Sharp paid de bid and got her.
I used to go to see her real often.


"We was fed just moderate. Dere was fifteen hands. When dey come in at
noon, dey ate from de big old kettle where de old colored woman had
cooked de food. De next morning after he bought me, de boss carried me
to de old woman and told her to take care of me. Dat morning de kettle
was full of spare ribs and de people fished dem out with sticks. I
didn't see no knives or forks. When dey asked me why I didn't get
something to eat, I asked 'bout dem and a table where I could eat. De
overseer just cried.


"De old lady took care of de children while de mothers worked. De oldest
one never went to de field. She just looked after de little ones. One
overseer was colored. He was an uncle of 'Big Nig' dat works at de
hotel. We was fanning out wheat and one of de children was raking out de
wheat. He talked back to de overseer who struck him. Dere was a
singletree under de edge of de cloth. De master picked up de singletree
but didn't strike de overseer, he backed off. Col. Harper raised oodles
of tobacco. Dere were 16 to 17 hundred pounds to de hogshead. He raised
15 to 20 hogsheads.


"My mother-in-law was from Memphis. One day dey went to church and de Ku
Klux Klan came in and beat de people over deir heads with pistols. De
people went out de doors and windows. Dey could just blow a horn and de
Ku Klux Klan would come from all directions.


"I was sold for $715. When de freedom come, I said, 'Give me $715 and
I'll go back.' Col. Harper just gave me a quarter to buy my dinner.
After de freedom, I worked in wheat harvest all season for $.75 a day. I
worked for a week and my mammy told me to bring her some bacon. When de
man paid me, I spent it all for a side of bacon. I felt mighty proud to
take dat to her. Bacon was $.50 a pound. I stayed at Dr. Sharp's where
mother worked and done chores. Later I made rails. Dey paid me $14 a
month for cutting rail timber. I was paid at de postoffice and took de
money home and gave it to mammy.


"Col. Harper's wife was Gen. Price's niece and Col. Harper was a
recruiting officer for Gen. Price. Young men came dere to join de
southern army. Dey could always get a horse. De women stayed dere all de
time to make de suits for de soldiers. De Union soldiers tried deir best
to kill Col. Harper.


"One time I saved his life. Dey was going to kill him, 'bout 75 or 100
men on horses. I warned de Colonel two hours before dey got dere. Dis is
how it happened. Col. Harper gave me de first day of Christmas to go to
see my mother. Us children went out in de woods playing and when we come
back de yard was all cut up with horses hoofs. Dr. Sharp put me on my
horse and told me to tell Col. Harper dis message, dat 'dere was so many
soldiers dat you might get hurt, you can come again some other time.' I
told Col. Harper and he left. I didn't see him again until I was cutting
wheat.


"My mistress lived dere for some time without any menfolks 'round 'cept
de slaves. Dere was a horse kept dere on purpose so I could come to town
every day for de mail. After a while, my mistress and her daughter went
to Jarod Harris's to stay. Den I went to Harris's every morning for de
mistress orders and to Montgomery each afternoon for de mail. I took de
mail to de camp at night. Dat was Bill Anderson's camp over in Callaway
County. Dey moved dat camp pretty often but I found it. One time de
bushwhackers came to burn de depot but Col. Harper had it full of
tobacco and wheat so dey didn't burn it.


"Young Billy Mathis was a lieutenant. He used to come to see mistress
almost every day and bring her messages. Once a gang of blue coats was
coming down de road. He got on one of mistress' horses and she told me
to go 'long and bring de horse back. We went down through de woods with
de bullets whistling through de air and cutting off de limbs of de
trees."


Dave had apparently studied about the voodoo doctors and their wiles for
a question as to conjure doctors brought a quick response:


"We call dem 'two headed Negroes'. You know dat if he could do any
tricks he would keep dem from whipping him or selling him and dey
couldn't do dat or dey would have done it long time ago. Tear open a
pillow and sometimes dere is a mat of feathers. Sometimes dey puts
things under de door step but I don't pay no 'tention to it. Dey is some
dat thinks dere is something to it.


"Mother used to tell a tale 'bout when she was a little girl. Her mother
went to frolics but her father went to bed, he was always tired after
his day's work. One night my mother saw a woman come to her father's bed
and rub her hand over his head. It didn't wake him up. De next day he
took sick and soon died. I don't believe in hoodoo doctors but it is
like de blood hounds can run and tree a man but if you can't find de
goods it don't count.


"I worked in de hay harvest for $.50 a day. Common domestic for shirts
was $.50 a yard. It took six yards to make one shirt, dat was a week's
work. We lived on chickens. My mother raised a whole camp meeting of
chickens. Dere never was a better white man dan Dr. Sharp. When I
married I had four head of horses and three mules. I owed for one team
of horses. I took typhoid fever in August and was in bed until November.
Dr. Sharp and Dr. Bodine knew something was de matter but dey didn't
know what it was. When de note come due, I got on a horse and rode to
Dr. Sharp's. He wanted to know what I was doing on dat horse. I told him
'bout de note and he said, 'Hum, dat's what's been bothering you. Don't
you get off dat horse! I help you den you get back home and go to bed
and stay dere!' He just wrote a check for $90, I had already paid $300.
After I got well, I sold a span of mules to Joe McCleary and put de
check in de bank for Dr. Sharp. Dat was to pay him for de note and
taking care of me dat summer and fall.


"I was in de railroad home guards during de war. We had to keep de
people from tearing up de railroads. I fought Bill Anderson's men many a
time. Seems sort of queer when I used to take dem de mail but we kept
dem from burning de railroad bridges. I served for 'bout six months near
Macon."

Joe Higgerson




    *Interview with Joe Higgerson,*
    *Sedalia, Missouri.*
    *(Written by Geo. K.  Bartlett, Kansas City,*
    *from F.C. of Kathleen Williams.)*


    _How Did Uncle Joe Get Home?_


Living at 410 West Pettis Street, Sedalia, is Joseph Higgerson, a
pensioned Negro soldier of the Civil War, who can look back through the
long vista of years and visualize slave life in Missouri, when the
institution of slavery was at its most thriving period.


He was born a slave on a farm near Boonville, Missouri, in 1845 if his
claim of being 92 years old in the summer of 1937, is correct.


He is somewhat bent and withered and his appearance of great age is
accentuated by white patriarchal whiskers below the chin, while his
cheeks are clean shaven; a style much in vogue during the life time of
Horace Greeley.


His home, a little, four room, frame cottage, with its tiny front porch
set close against the picket fence enclosing the lot, mirrors somewhat
the deterioration age has placed upon its occupant. Both house and fence
are weather beaten, gray from age and lack of paint.


"Could you and would you tell about slavery days?" he was asked.


"Yes Ma'am," he courteously and smiling replied, the smile revealing
big, strong teeth. "Yes, indeed. Would you all step in the house and
set? I am so happy to have company."


He selected the dining room, which is also the comfortably furnished
living room, as the place to "set and talk". In this room is an oak
dining table, chairs and a china closet, through the glass doors of
which may be seen attractively decorated dishes, some of them of very
old pattern. There is also an old fashioned combination desk and book
case, and a chest of drawers. The windows are adorned with curtains and
drapes of good quality.


The clean condition of the interior was a revelation of a 92 year old
Negro man's desire and ability to keep house, and keep it clean. He
lives alone, his wife having died many years ago.


There is in the appearance of this ancient Negro with shoulders now
bowed; the dark brown skin, extending across the bald head; the large
nose; immense teeth; shaven cheeks below which a mat of white whiskers
encircle the throat, like the ruff on a condor's neck; there is in his
appearance that which stamps him at once as the living bridge between
the present day's civilization and a dim past; the knowledge of which
exists today in the memories of but few persons.


As he talked, strange sights, scenes and cultures were told, sometimes
with words that have changed much in meaning.


As his mind pictured the scenes of those old days, this primitive
blending of both Indian and Negro races, at times unconsciously reverted
to the primitive sing song recitative chant of his ancestors,
particularly when narrating his outstanding pleasant memories.


This is his story:


"Old man Higgerson was my mastar. We lived on a farm and dere was a big
family of us. I is the only one left. The farm laid just below the
Lamine and Missouri Rivers, and I can't tell exactly where it was.
Everybody called us 'free niggahs'--cause Higgerson slaves was treated
so good. Yes, ma'am. My mammy lived to be 80 years old--and didn't have
a gray hair in her haid. She was part Black Hawk Indian,--and I show it
in me too."


Then as his thoughts raced back to slavery days, the pictures of youth
crowded thick and fast, and he burst forth into a half chanted
description of the panorama of his memories. "I've seen hundreds of
Indians pass thru the country, on foot. Boss man let' em have a shack
overnight. Next mawnin dey set out on foot, and take up de road, one
behind the othar. Yes, suh! Just wrapped in a blanket one behind the
othar. Winter and summer, and barefoot too!"


Then he told of game and game ways.


"Yes suh! I done seen wild deer hop ovar fences, and hundreds of wild
turkeys. We used to build turkey pens and dig a trench, put feed in dere
and covar it ovar wid bresh and de turkeys would come to feed, and we
would trap' em. Yes, ma'am, an I done seen 100 to 150 wild turkeys in a
flock. I has dat! Lots of wild pigeons, too. I has seen a thousand geese
flyin' over in the early mornin'. Then I've trapped quail too, in rail
pens, built ten feet square. Yes, suh!


"But listen!--slaves couldn't shoot; was a law agin it in slaves times;
no slave could own or shoot a gun. We couldn't shoot game. An' dat come
dis way. President Jackson say, 'Keep books and guns outa slaves' hands
if you want to keep 'em slaves'."


Joe Higgerson chuckled a little with a glint of humor in his eyes and
changed the subject.


"Everybody made whiskey in dem days, had little 'stilleries all over the
country, made apple and peach brandy. Good too. One day I was sent to a
neighbor's for brandy. I took a little taste and walked on. Den I took
anoder little taste, and walked on. Den I took anoder little taste and
sot down de jug. Den I took anoder little taste, and so on and so on.
Pretty soon I looked up, and I nevar did know how I got to whar I'se
gwin ter. Nobody ever say anything about it or tell me nuffin! I guess
somebody carry me whar I'se gwin ter."


He was asked if he ever remembered seeing slaves sold at Boonville.


"Yes, ma'am!" he exclaimed. "Why down at Boonville, woman and a baby was
put up to be sold, and de buyer he want de woman, but he don't want de
baby, so they separated 'em, and was gettin' ready to put 'em on de boat
for Noo Orleans, and ship 'em down de river, and de woman she ran back
to kiss de baby goodbye, and de tradar picked up a whip and cracked it
and shouts, 'A bellerin' cow will soon forget its calf'. She was sold
down de river and nevar saw de baby again. Now dat was sad." He paused
and then resumed.


"One tradar, name of Henry Moore, he used to handcuff all the niggahs
together till time to put 'em on de boat for Noo Orleans. Dey always
carried whips and they'd crack dem to see how far de darkies could jump.
Yes, Suh!! Yes, Suh!!! Deed they did!!!"


This reminiscence tickled him mightily and he laughed heartily at
thoughts of the capers the negroes cut when the whip cracked.


"An I remembers one boat load. Boat load got as far as Cairo, Illinois,
and lots of de darkies jumped overboard and was drowned."


"Were the overseers on the plantations Negroes or whites?"


"Overseahs, white," Higgerson replied, "Overseahs white. A darky was the
niggah driver. Darkies didn't ever get to go to the big house where the
planter lived. De niggah driver reported to the overseah, and the
overseah reported to the boss.


"Now this is the way with me," Higgerson continued. "My father, who was
also my boss, he kept a store, and I went to de store to take care of de
children, cause de boss done send for me. Well, one time when the wah
was on, some Federal soldiers come and done scared me so bad I forgot
all about de chile and run home, and de soldiers burned de bridge, you
had to cross befo' you got to de store. So after dat de ole man run a
boat across."


Hoping to get some idea of how Christmas was celebrated among the
Negroes on the farms and plantations the aged man was asked what he
remembered of Christmas, in slavery times.


"One Christmas I never goin' to forget", he replied.


"Jes before Christmas lots of people came to de store to buy and de
groun' was all covered wid snow. An de man what run de store was getting
ready to close up, cause it was getting dark, and close at dark a man
come and wanted in and de store keeper wouldn't let him in. An it got
later and later, and by an by Joseph, dats me, was sent to de store to
find why de storekeeper ain't come home yet and Joseph went to de store,
and looked in and saw de old man on his back, his throat cut wid de
blood runnin' all over de floor and $1,400 dey knowed he had--gone. Dere
was whiskey and blood runnin' all over de floor. Whiskey was cheap dem
days; good whiskey, too.


"When they set the niggahs free, the boss man come out and read de
papers to 'em sayin' dey was free. And I went to Boonville and joined de
Union Army, November 23, 1863. I served in de 25th Corps, Second
Division under General Whitsell. I was in de last battle of de war at
Palmetto Ranch, Texas, on de Rio Grande, just 36 miles from de Gulf.
When I was discharged from de army to go home, I thought--why I have no
home, where shall I go? Den I decided to go back to Boonville. All my
family was scattered.


"But I was lucky. Someone had started to build a shack, and had not
finished it. I got permission to finish it and picked up building
material here and dere, and made it into a home. I never been without a
home since. My wife and I lived together 61 years. She is gone now."

    *St. Louis County, Missouri.*
    *(Written by Grace E. White,*
    *St. Louis, Mo.)*


    _Smoked 'Em Upside Down_


The subject of this sketch is Delia Hill, over 90 years old. She lives
at 1338 Argus Street, St. Louis County, Missouri.


Delia Hill is a good natured, well preserved old lady. She is quite
tall, medium in size, dark complexion and her hair is almost entirely
white. She is very neat in her quaint, frame three room cottage. She
shares her home with a widowed companion who appears to be well in her
50's but is able to work. Delia Hill's story follows:


"I was born in Cold Water, Mississippi more dan 90 years ago but don't
know jes' how old I is. My first owner's name was Marse John Hawkins and
he had a big mill. He had me and my mother with 14 other chillen, Aunt
Ellen and her 8 chillen, and Aunt Tilda with all her chillen. I don't
know how many Aunt Tilda had. Anyhow Marse John owned every one of us.
Later on he sold me to Marse Dave Stafford, a circuit rider. I got a
scar on my eye today whar de ole overseer throwed a fork at me cross de
table, 'cause I went to sleep, I was so tired while fanning flies off
him while he's eatin'. I had to fan flies every meal time with a fly
brush. They worked me so hard, I'd just go on to sleep standin' up. Dat
old overseer was a mean old devil any how. Well when old Marse come home
from de circuit ridin' I told him 'bout it, and he fired dat overseer
right then and told him if my eye went out, he would look him up and
kill him. I never seed him anymore.


"Dey sold us niggahs so bad down dere where I come from, dat when I was
little I got sold from my mother and she never found me till after de
war in 1871. Was we glad to see each other? I say we was. I was raised
up hard, honey. I can count de winters I ever even had shoes on my poor
feet. When Marse Dave bought my mother he only bought her and 6 us
chillun. He was fairly nice to niggahs, but he didn't have as big a
drove of 'em as de other plantation owners, but child we could hear
niggahs hollen' every night on different plantations all around us from
lashings dey gittin' from dere old overseers and masters too, for dat
matter.


"My owner raised mostly cotton and corn, my mother wove all de clothes
we wore, she even done all de spinning. During de Civil War, my old Miss
use to hide us niggahs in de woods to keep de Yankees from seein' us.
Dey pass through our place and got most all our stock just de same and
all dey wanted to eat besides. But dey never found a one of us. After
dey pass by we all go on back home.


"Dey sent us to church reglar and de preacher say to us, any you all see
anybody stealin' old Miss chickens or eggs, go straight to old Miss and
tell her who 'tis and all about it. Any one steal old Marse hogs or
anything belong to old Marse, go straight to him and tell him all about
it. Den he ask us, what your daddy bring home to you when he come, and
what he feed you chillun at night. We scared to death to tell anything
'cause, honey, if we did de niggah get a killin, and our mammy tie up
our feet and hang us upside down by our feet, build a fire under us and
smoke us, scare us plum to death. We swear mammy goin' to burn us up.
Lord, child, dat was an awful scare. Yes, mam, it was. De old preacher
told us go on work hard, tell old Miss and old Master de truth and when
we die God going let us in heaven's kitchen and sit down and rest from
all dis work we doin' down here.


"We believe dat den. We didn't know no better, honest we didn't, honey.
Our old Miss used to tell us, I want all my niggers to always tell de
truth. If dey kill you, die telling de truth. But bless your soul, our
mammy done smoked 'nough of us up side down, to not tell dem white folks
nothin', a lie, nor the truth. No sir'ree. Who want to get smoked up
likely to burn up hanging there as not. Now ain't dat so? No, sir, tell
dem white folks, dey find out anything, they jes' find out by
themselves, dat's it. I never did read or write. I been married three
times. My last husband I married October 31, 1901 and moved right out
here in dis house November 6, 1901, been here ever since. My husband
been dead now 18 years. My children all died while dey was babies. I had
six children. I wear glasses sometimes, but I praise God I can see good
without glasses.


"De government gives me a pension and I git along fairly middlin'. Since
peace been declared I made my living doing laundry work and cooking. I
nursed right smart in Memphis. My mother died in 1893 here in St. Louis.
Her name was Eliza Mullin, but I never did know how old she was. She
didn't neither. I am a Baptist and go to church reglar as I kin, but I
suffer so hard with indigestion. I can't go no place much. Guess dat's
'bout all I can remember worth 'membering, hope it helps de book out."








Louis Hill




    *Interview with Louis Hill,*
    *age 78, Farmington, Missouri.*


"I's borned on October 13, 1858 on the southeast side of Farmington,
Missouri. My muthuh, Rose Hill, was borned in Virginia. She kum ta
Missouri as a girl an frum dat time on she wuz a slabe fur John Hill,
our boss. She worked thar till our freedom. Our family had three boys,
Peter, William, and me an two girls, Sallie and Malinda. We bunked up in
a cabin with one room. All us kids ate on da flo frum da same plate an
da biggest dog got da mos. We generally wore a straight slip like a
nightgown an hit fastened round the neck. (In the old South boys were
dressed in this fashion until about ten years old and were called
"shirttail boys".) Tak dis off an we war naked.


"The ole lady, the wife ob da Boss was da devil's sister. Her name was
'Whip'. She beat da ole folks mor'n tha kids. She used tha cowhide an we
got a lickin' whether we did anythin' or not. We had ta git up early an
after given supper we war put ta bed an did not 'pilfer' round. We had
ta go on Sunday ta the Boss' Church, tha Carmelite or Christian Church.
Ma muthuh wuz no han ta tell big yarns an so I know no ghost stories. We
wuz raised very sensible. Tha white folks did not help us ta read an
write. I learned that after we war free. I never did go ta school. Our
games was 'Wolf on tha Bridge', an 'King-Kong-Ko.' We always had ta be
doin' somethin', even if it war pickin' up kindlin'.


"I member when Price's army kum thro here in '64 or '65 on their way ta
Pilot Knob. I wuz 'bout six or seben years ole. I an ma sister had bin
down ta the white childr'n school ta take them dinner. We had ta bring
tha basket bak an we sat down in tha corner ob da graveyard ta eat whut
wuz left in da basket. Da graveyard was nex to da Fredericktown road and
jus across frum our house. All at onc't I heard the mos' turrible noise
an saw soldiers kum up da road. We war sure scared. We jumped up, ran
cross da road, jumped over da fence an begun ta tak out fur da house. Da
soldiers laughed an said somethin. One soldier on a horse kum up ta de
fence, tore off da top rail, an with his horse jumped ober da fence, an
took out after us, but he nebber cud catch us. We wuz sho runnin'. I wuz
carryin' da basket and if I had a throwed it down we would a showed that
soldier some runnin'. Da soldier turned his horse round but we went
straight to da house to da Missus. She say dat dey was only havin' a
good time an would not hurt us. We stood at da house an looked, an it
took 'bout all afternoon fur da soldiers to pass. Thar war horses,
wagons and cannons. Da soldiers durin' da war took all da Boss' horses
away an he had only a yoke ob oxen lef.


"After da freedom we all had ta get out an work. We had a big family. I
work'd at da lead smelter at Mine La Motte in 1872 an work'd thar fur
six years. I made $2.50 a day an dat was good wages then. I batched
thar. I larned ta read at Mine La Motte when a white man taught me in
evenin's at da mine between shifts. Afterwards I work'd in Bonne Terre
at da smelter but got lead colic an quit thar.


"I think slavery wuz a curse on human nature. I believe in nobody bein'
in bondage ob no kind. Da Almighty wuz not a goin' ta let slavery las'
much longer. You know whut He did about da people in Egypt."


(Note--Louis Hill lives in a very nice home. He is a quiet negro, and
except for a short time, has spent his entire life in Farmington. He
receives an Old Age Pension. I did not inquire about his marriage, for,
from knowledge I have gained, he lives with a colored woman to whom he
is not married.)


    *Interview with Louis Hill,*
    *Farmington, Missouri.*


    _He Swapped Liquor For Lessons_


How he traded liquor for lessons in reading, writing, and arithmetic is
one of the interesting facts of his younger life recalled in an
interview recently obtained from Louis Hill, an ex-slave, now living in
Farmington, Missouri.


Louis believes that the government should have made some provision for
the aid of the Negroes during the early struggle following their
emancipation.


Regarding the part which he takes in politics, Louis declares that his
invariable rule is to "look over de field and vote for what he thinks is
de best timber."


The story of his experiences as given to the interviewer is told as
closely as possible in his own words which follow:


"I was too young to know what to expect from freedom. My mother picked
up and left de white folks in de night and took us kids with her. Dat
was after we was free but dey wouldn't let her get away in de daytime
very handy. Dey did not pay my mother anything after she was free. In
dem days kids didn't question de old folks like they does now, so I
didn't find out much. Dere was two sisters, two brothers and myself what
left dat night with my mother. We all had some bundles, and when we left
de old mistress in de dark we went to some neighbors several blocks
away. We didn't have to go far away 'cause dey could not force you to go
back after we was free. But my mother did go back and work for de
mistress a good while but she got paid den. We stayed here for quite
awhile and den went up to Valle Mines.


"I piddled around and hired out for first one and den another and did
what a kid could do. When you earned any money dem days you had to give
it to your mother and didn't know what she done with it. About de first
work I done was for Mr. Boyer, a Frenchman, up in Valle Mines in de
diggin's. I dug mineral, zinc, etc. I got 50 cents a day. He did all de
diggin and I 'coached' it from de head of the drift to de shaft. I had a
little car on wheels dat run on a wooden track. I reckon I worked for
him 'bout two years. My mother would go out to de big dirt pile called
'scrappin' and would pick out de zinc and lead chunks and little pieces.


"Purt near every Saturday we would take de ore down to Furnace Town and
get it weighed and get a check for it. Den we come back to Farmington
after several years and lived with my sister's husband and worked around
at a little bit of everything. I was gettin' to be a pretty good sized
boy and went to Mine La Motte and worked on de furnace. My first work at
dat place was at $2 a day and later on I became a 'charger' and got
$2.50 a day. I stayed with dem six or seven years. After I left dere I
went to Bonne Terre and got married and got mine sickness or lead colic
from workin' in de furnace and had to quit. I come back to Farmington
and is been here ever since. Den I worked at sawing wood, chopping wood,
and at a soda factory and beer depot and peddled ice and delivered soda
and beer to Knob Lick, Syenite, Graniteville and Bonne Terre. I worked
here for a long time.


"I'se had four children and two is livin. De boy is in Los Angeles,
California and the girl is in Seattle, Washington. My boy is a chauffeur
for an old, rich feller by de name of Clark and he has been in de same
job for 16 years. He gets $100 a month, room and board. He's been
wanting to quit but de old man won't let him. My son's daughter does de
cooking for dis rich guy. My son is 56 years old now.


"My daughter is 54 and is married. What she does is more dan I can tell
you. Her husband was a soldier in de regular army, in de 10th Cavalry,
and was in de Philippines, and Cuba and so my daughter is been around
some. She been away from here for about 23 or 24 years.


"I think de young Negroes need settling down and have more education and
not so much good time. I didn't have much of a chance. We was turned
loose barefooted and had no schools den and when dey had schools I had
to work. But in Mine La Motte a Mr. McFarland would come over to our
cabin and teach me readin', writin' and 'rithmetic. He was an awful
drinker but was smart. I would give him a little something to drink for
teachin' me. I took lessons for 'bout a year. I sure do like to read de
newspapers now and can write letters. The young generation thinks too
much about goin' and having a good time. A little 'task master' wouldn't
hurt de young people. I wasn't in de slavery long enough for it to hurt
me none. I was free when I was 5 years old. My mother, however, was
worked like an old horse and de best part of her life was spent in
bondage.


"I believe de government should have made some provision for de slaves
when dey turned dem loose. De government could have compelled
slaveholders to give slaves a little track of land, a cow and a horse
and give 'em a start. De slave had made what de white man had. I
actually believe de Negroes would be better off today if they had done
dis. My old mistress just had oodles of land. Of course de white folks
was not used to work and dere was plenty for de Negroes to do if dey
wanted to work.


"I voted as soon as I got a chance. De first time I voted was in 1880.
I'se had 'em try to pay me to vote but I told dem my vote was not for
sale. You know you ain't dictated to unless you is 'wishy washy'. Once,
a feller asked me how I voted. I said, 'Just to suit myself.' I
generally look over de field and vote for what I think is de best
timber. Dey is goin' to have a hot time in 1940, for dem that lives to
see it. It's a free country and a man should not have to own property in
order to vote. Dey ought not to oppress anyone."








Rhody Holsell




    *Interview with "Aunt" Rhody Holsell,*
    *Fredericktown, Missouri.*


    _Slaves Happy To Be Free_


"Aunt" Rhody Holsell, 89 years old, of Fredericktown, is one of the
interesting ex-slaves in Missouri. According to her story she was 17
years old when the Civil War ended. Her mother and father were slaves
and both of them had died before the beginning of the conflict. She
believes that she is part Indian as her great grandmother is believed to
have been an Indian squaw.


The following is her own version of events which played a part in her
life during her slave days and since that time:


"When dey turned me loose I was naked, barefoot, and didn't have nothin'
to start out on. They turned us loose without a thing and we had to
kinda pick ourselves up. We would go out of a Sunday and dig ginseng and
let it dry for a week and sell it to de store. We would make about a
dollar every Sunday dat way, and den we'd get our goods at de store. The
master and all de boys was killed in de war and de mistress married some
'hostle jostle' who helped to kill the boss. I was jus' not goin' to
stand dat so dis was when I left home.


"Abraham Lincoln done put a piece in de paper saying dat all de slaves
was free and if dey whipped any of de slaves after dey was set free dey
would prosecute them. Me and another little old woman done some shoutin'
and hollerin' when we heard 'bout de freedom. We tore up some corn down
in de field. De old missus was right there on de fence but wouldn't dare
touch us den. Once de mistress struck me after we was freed and I
grabbed her leg and would have broke her neck. She wanted to apologize
with me de way she had treated me but I would not let her. They thought
it was awful dat dey could not whip de slaves any longer.


"I den worked from one farm to another. I would stay a year or two each
place. Dey wanted me to stay. Dey said I was de best plow boy dey had. I
would cut de old roots and dey would pop but dey paid me nothin' and dey
didn't give you no clothes. We got so much in de share of de cropping
but dey would not share with me so I would leave. So I come to
Fredericktown to try to find my mother's people but when I got here dey
done told me dey was gone to Illinois.


"I den come right out of de field and went right into the dining room. I
was never turned off from any of my work. I would just work 'till I got
tired and quit. Talk about bein' happy! We was sure 'nough some happy
people when dey done took dat yoke offen our necks. Before I was free we
had to shuck three wagon loads of corn a day. De wagon would hold 40
bushels. I'd come home and my fingers would be twisted from so much
work. De oxen would slobber all over de corn before we picked it. It was
cold out dere in de field an' I would wrap my feet up in my dress and
wait till de wagon would drive up. I had no shoes on. Man, I don't know
how I'm here today. It just was de mercy of God that took care of me.
When my mother was dying she done asked God to look over us and it must
have been her prayer dat helped me to still be here.


"When my mother was sick once de doctor come and brought his wife. De
wife always come with de doctor. De doctor would not allow de family to
give de medicine, 'cause he said de family would give in to de sick
person. De wife of de doctor would give de medicine when de doctor was
asleep. I never seen de family give medicine till I come up here. De
doctors always come and stay till de sick person was out of danger and
de wife always come with him.


"Lord, people nowadays don't know nothing 'bout nothin'. Child, I spun
backwards and forwards to de wheel till I wore my feet out till de balls
of my feet was wore to de blood.


"Lots of slaves went to Illinois after freedom, but I never been out of
de State. I don't go to frolics of any kind. I just come here and
settled down and never rambled 'round. I've lived in dis house 55 years
and have buried purty near all my family right out of dis house. I ain't
never had a fuss with any of my neighbors, and I done took de bitter
with de sweet. I ride in an automobile only to funerals. I ain't been on
a train but once or twice and dat was 'bout 40 years ago. I'm interested
in church now, can sit and listen to preachin' and singin' all day, but
I sets right here while dey has all dis other excitement. It's been
seventy years since I done been to Farmington to a picnic. I don't want
de pension so much to roam around but to be protected in my old age and
to have a few more days of peace. I don't care nothin' about clothes.


"I been votin' at that thing ever since it started. Dey would take me a
free ride when votin' time comes. You can't turn around for dey wants to
take you to vote. But after de voting dey won't pay no attention to me.
I never did vote only a straight ticket and I always went my own way.
Dey would sometimes tell me how to vote but I didn't pay them no mind.
My husband did not believe in women voting and he said it would tear up
de country. He said he wanted to be in heaven when de women voted.
Garfield was de first president I ever voted for.


"I believe it would been better to have moved all de colored people way
out west to dem selves. Abraham Lincoln wanted to do dis. It would have
been better on both races and dey would not have mixed up. But de white
people did not want de 'shade' taken out of de country. Many of de
bosses after de freedom couldn't stand it and went in de house and got a
gun and blew out his brains. If Lincoln had lived he would have
separated us like dey did de Indians. We would not have been
slaughtering, burning, hanging, and killin' if we had been put to
ourselves, and had our own laws. Many a person is now in torment because
of dis mixup. God give us a better principle and we could have had
thousands of whites slaughtered but we didn't after the freedom.


"De present generation is a lost condition. If dey don't girdle their
lines and pull dem up closer and ask God to help 'em and quit going to
dem 'hog holes' and drinkin' it is going to be death and destruction.
Dis not only is true of the Negroes but white folks, too. Mother and
father think it is alright. Dese undertakers is goin' out all de time,
night and day, on the highways and pickin' up de carcass of people. It's
sin dat is wrong with de world. De future of the Negro is of the past.
We have some good friends among the white folks but de devil is just got
so strong dat de good can't hardly stand. We have some good citizens in
dis town. I can't read or write but I used to have the white lady read
the funny side of the paper when I set down to eat.


"Once during de war de soldiers was around me very thick. I was coming
back from carryin' de dinner out in de woods to Sam Hildebrand. I took
him a table cloth, napkins and everything first class. I went down to de
house and hid de basket in a hollow log and crossed de creek and dey
hollered, 'Halt!' De soldiers was cussin' me like a bay steer. Dey said,
'I'll kill you right here and blow your brains out if you don't tell.' I
told dem I had been up dere to water de calves so dey give me my pass
and let me go on to de house. I would not tell dem nothin' 'bout Sam
Hildebrand nor where he was hiding. While Sam et his meal I would stand
'round and watch in de woods. I was de oldest one on de place and I was
de only one what had to carry his meals to him.


"I would get up many mornings and hear the bugler blowin'. Das when dey
was callin' the pickets in. You would see de pickets come in just
a-flyin' and out sent de fresh pickets on duty. I was not scared of dem.
Sometimes de soldiers stayed 'round our place for two weeks and camped.
Dey was about 500 and de men laid out on de ground under a government
wagon and in some houses around about. Dese soldiers would go out with
sabers and whack de heads off of de sheep, hogs, and calves and in about
five minutes would have dat yearlin' skinned and dash it into de boilin'
kettle. Den dey would take a long knife and cut off a big piece of meat
with the blood runnin' out. Dey did not cook de meat done and did not
put much salt on it. It sure was funny, seein' dem soldiers eatin' a big
hunk of meat with de blood runnin' out. Dey always had bread but don't
know where dey got it. They was so tired and wore out and their feet was
sore and de infantry was almost barefooted. Dey was always dressed in
blue. Sometimes we would have 30 or 40 yards of goods on de loom and dey
would tear it off and send it home to their family. We was glad enough
to get dem to take dis and get out. There would not be a man on de place
when these 500 soldiers come. We always managed to bury dat gentleman
(money). I can remember the boss took out of his chest his money, enough
to fill the table, and put it in a buck skin bag and he went off with
another man. I don't know what become of de money and dey was killed and
there was no one left to tell de tale.


"I sure had it rough and tumble since de war. Of course I don't have a
boss now. I've worked on de farm, as a dining room girl, washin',
ironing, and hiring out. I would get about $9 to $10 a week. I was
workin' for de railroad people den when de road was runnin' strong here.
My husband he died 40 years ago and he done left me with about 15 cents,
and the mortgage on dis house was about $130. I had a wagon worth about
$40 and old Dr. Newberry took dat for his bill. Den I would do two or
three washings before I come home and would come by de undertaker's and
leave him some money on de funeral. My daughter is a grass widow and she
lives here. Her ex-husband shines shoes down town, but he don't help us
none. My daughter has got three children.


"I don't go to church lately. It's embarrassing to go in this hot
weather. I know where I want dem to bury me. All the old folks buried
out at de old colored cemetery.


"I goes down here to de store and if I can't get de money dey waits till
I can, I can get it on a credit. Dey think Aunt Rhody is one of the
leadin' persons of de town. Of course I don't run all over town but go
to one store. Dey have got used to me and dey know it sometimes takes an
hour for me to make up my mind what I want to buy. When I go to de store
they kid me and say: 'Why, Aunt Rhody, ain't you dead yet? You is goin'
to outlive us all.'


"Slavery learnt me how to work and I wasn't feared of no kind of work.
Most of de people around here don't know nothin' 'bout work. A little
slavery would do dis young age some good and dey is goin' to get it. Dis
young generation is slaughtering our people up, down in de south. Our
people don't know what freedom is down there. Better not go down there
and talk about freedom. My brother went down there in the south and got
back so far from de river dat he never got out. I guess de exposure and
the beatin' killed him. Lots of places dey votes down there, but de
votes is thrown in de waste basket and dey don't count. These people
can't beat up us people and jump up on a bed and close their eyes and
die and expect to go to heaven.


"I ain't never heard de Bible read till I was free in Fredericktown.
When we was slaves we did not have much time to get out and sin much.
Dis generation is goin' to destruction. It's all on account of not
minding their parents. Dey is just hard-headed. It's caused by de way de
old folks acted and is bein' put on dis present generation. I tell 'em,
you don't think dat you can walk these streets and fall dead and never
said nothin' to God to move this gulf of sin and den expect to go to
Heaven. I'm tryin' to serve God and fightin' all de time against de
devil to keep him from knockin' me over. I'm not a person to go on with
a lot of nonsense. I talk to de young people all de time around de
stores and tell 'em dey is got to get up from there to make it across de
river. Dey all talk about me preachin' a sermon around de stores. But de
devil's already got de 'bill of sale' on dem. I'm talkin' to de Lord all
de time cause my stay is going to be mighty short now."


    *"Aunt Rhody" Holsell,*
    *Fredericktown, Missouri.*
    *Interviewed by J. Tom Miles.*


"I've lived in Fredericktown ever since de war and only two or three
times I've been out of hollering distance of town. I was seventeen years
old when de war was over. My boss was Thos. McGee in Wayne County. My
mother and father were slaves. My great-grandmother was a Indian squaw.
My mother was dead four years 'fore de war and my father was dead three
years.


"I sure can 'member 'bout de war. De funniest thing was some soldiers
camped at our house. Man, I would pull weeds in de cotton patch, and
when I got a little older I was a-carding and spinning and dat wheel was
a-singing. I spun all de chain all through de Civil War and I spun all
de warp. De boss treated us very good. De boss would know every row of
corn we would hoe; sometimes we would break de corn off and den we got a
whipping with a weed.


"De boss lost all three of his boys with their shoes on in de war, but
dey did not join de army. De boss was also killed. De boss had a race
horse and de soldiers found dis out an de boss tried to get de hoss out
of de state to New Orleans until after de war. My brother got de race
hoss down there all right. My brother got on Knight and rode clear to
Cape and his closes were torn off. He get to Cape just as de boat was
pulling out. Dey killed de boss when he got on another hoss an he was
shot 'cause de soldiers thought he was on de race hoss. Dey killed de
boss in August on Monday. De boss was going that day to Greenville to
make his will.


"After de war I worked my way to Fredericktown. I started out bareheaded
an barefooted. I worked from one farm to another. I worked at one farm
for two years and at another for one year. These people paid me a
little. It took 'bout five years 'fore I got to Fredericktown. I did
anything. I cradled five acres of oats and my husband bound it. I didn't
fear no kind of boss. I have ten great grand-children, and one
great-great-grandchild.


"I took Sam Hildebrand's dinner to him many times and when Sam was
killed in Southern Illinois dey tried to get me to go up to Farmington
to identify him. But I would not do it. I told dem dat he had a mark
behind his shoulder dat dey could see. I 'member once when Sam
Hildebrand was shot and came to our place to have his sore washed out. I
held de wash pan for old Tom McGee to wash his wound.


"De old folks had all kinds of tea to heal people. De old mistress took
de 'ridicue' [TR: reticule] with her and would be gone for a week going
from one sick person to another. My boss caused my mother's death. She
was on a wagon of oats and was being pulled by a yoke of oxen. De wagon
turned and she fell off on a sapling and it went through her skin and
dey had to saw de sapling off and she had to lay with dat snag in her
side till de doctor twenty miles away come. It was in August and she
died with poison. Her coffin was made right out on de work bench. Dey
didn't have anything in de coffin but a winding sheet scolloped nicely
and a shroud for de body. It was a miracle to me when I came up here to
see how dey dressed up de dead people. When I die just wrap me in a
clean sheet. That was what my fore-parents had. It's better to think
whar dat soul is. Two wheel carts was mostly used at funerals in those
days with oxen. The driver would be walking along beside driving.


"De Boss said one man was treated mean and they could not do anything
with him. The old fellow would play his gourd and de snakes would come
'round. Finally dey sent him down to New Orleans and sold him on de
block.


"If you move on Saturday you won't stay long. If de boss decides about
you on Tuesday or Friday these are hanging days. I can't read or write
but I have a little mother sense. We have three spirits, evil spirit in
de grave, another spirit which is wandering, and a spirit in heaven.


"I think slavery is good for dem dat understands it. We are all slaves
now. We have a rough and tumble business. Slavery was cruel but it's
about as bad now. Them days they didn't hang anybody for doing bad
things. I may be wrong. I been voting ever since de mess got up. My
husband said he wanted to be in heaven when de women would be messin'
'round among de men and voting. I wish we had a whole lot of Abraham
Lincolns now. He did a great deed when he took de yoke off us colored
people. We will get a little rest anyway."








Henry Johnson




    *Interview with Henry Johnson,*
    *St. Louis, Missouri.*
    *(Written by Grace E. White.)*


The subject of this sketch is Henry Johnson, over ninety years of age,
living at 1526 Hanley Road, Lincoln Terrace, St. Louis, Missouri. Henry
is of dark complexion and has a wealth of long white hair and feminine
features.


His eyesight is good. He is in excellent health for his age. The old man
admits that his main weakness is chewing tobacco. He was seated in the
living room of his 4-room, old fashioned frame cottage which is poorly
furnished, but clean, where he lives with his wife, at least twenty-five
years younger than himself. His story follows:


"My name is Henry Johnson. I was born in Patrick County, Virginia and
was raised all over de state. I was only sold twice. My father's name
was Bill Alexander and my mother's name was Fannie, but I didn't know
nothin' 'bout my parents till I was past eighteen years old or about
that. I never knowed my real age. My owner's name was Billy Johnson in
Patrick County so I always carried his name. When I was a little bit 'a
fellow, I used to pack water to twenty-five and thirty men in one field,
den go back to de house and bring enough water for breakfast de next
morning. When I got a little bigger, I had to take a little hoe and dig
weeds out of de crop. If our white boss see a little grass we overlooked
he would handcuff our feet to a whipping post, den chain the slave
around de stomach to de post and strap de chin over de top of de post
and place your hands in front of you.


"In de start de slave has been stripped naked, and lashed, often to
death. Dey would be left strapped after from twenty-five to fifty lashes
every two or three hours to stand dere all night. De next day, de
overseer would be back with a heavy paddle full of holes that had been
dipped in boiling water and beat until de whole body was full of
blisters. Den he'd take a cat-o'-nine-tails dipped in hot salt water to
draw out de bruised blood and would open everyone of dem blisters with
dat. If de slave did not die from dat torture, he would be unfastened
from de whipping post, and made go to de field just as he was. Often
times he would die shortly after. Dey did the women de same."


Here he showed the writer scars on his head and shoulders which he said
were from those beatings.


"I never knowed what a shirt was until I was past twenty. When my young
master went three miles to school, he rode on a horse, I had to walk
along side de horse to carry his books, den go home and fetch him a hot
dinner for noon and go back after him at night to carry dem books.


"My boss had eleven children. He had one hundred and twenty-five slaves
on one of de plantations, two hundred on another. On all his plantations
he owned better'n 1500 slaves. He was one of de richest land owners in
de state of Virginia. He often told me I was born just one hour before
his youngest son. I stayed with dat family until way after de war was
fought.


"Dey would take a great string of slaves in de road on Sunday and make
us walk to church. Buggies with de white folks in would be in front of
us, in de midst of us, and all betwixt and behind us. When we got dat
four or five miles we had to sit on a log in de broiling sun, while a
white man preached to us. All dey evah would say would be niggers obey
your masters and mistress and don't steal from 'em. And lo and behold,
honey, de masters would make us slaves steal from each of the slave
owners. Our master would make us surround a herd of his neighbor's
cattle, round dem up at night, and make us slaves stay up all night long
and kill and skin every one of dem critters, salt the skins down in
layers in de master's cellar, and put de cattle piled ceilin' high in de
smoke house so nobody could identify skinned cattle.


"Den when de sheriff would come around lookin' for all dem stolen
critters, our boss would say, 'Sheriff, just go right on down to dem
niggahs' cabins and search dem good, I know my niggers don't steal.'
Course de sheriff come to our cabins and search, sure we didn't have
nothin' didn't belong to us, but de boss had plenty. After de sheriff's
search, we had to salt and smoke all dat stolen meat and hang it in old
marse smoke house for him. Den dey tell us, don't steal. Dey raised
turkeys in de 500 lots and never did give us one. So we wanted one so
bad once, I put corn underneath de cabin and a turkey, a great big one,
would come under our cabin to eat dat corn. One day when I got a chance
I caught dat old gobbler by de neck and him and me went round and round
under dat old cabin house. He was de biggest strongest bird I ever see,
I was only a boy but finally I beat. I twisted his neck till he died.
Den I took out up to de big house, fast as anything, to tell my old miss
one of our finest turkeys dead. She said stop cryin' Henry and throw him
under de hill. I was satisfied. I run back, picked dat ole bird, taken
all his feathers to de river and throwed dem in. Dat night we cooked
him, and didn't we eat somethin' good. I had to tell her 'bout dat
missin' bird 'cause when dey check up it all had to tally so dat fixed
dat.


"My old master told me when de war was being fought and the Yankees was
on de way coming through Franklin County, Virginia, 'My little niggah,
do you know how old you is?' I said: 'No sah, boss.' He said: 'You are
seventeen years old.' I never even saw my mother and father until I was
in my twenties. A white man taken me to Danville, Virginia to drive his
carriage for him. After I was dere a spell a colored man kept watching
me so much I got plum scared. Dis was after de war was over. Den one
day, lo and behold, he jumped at me and he grabbed me and asked me where
was I staying. I did not know whether to tell him or not, I was so
scared. Den he said I am your father and I am goin' to take you to your
mother and sisters and brothers down in Greenville, Virginia. When he
got me dere, I found two sisters and four brothers. Dey was all so glad
to see me dey shouted and cried and carried on so I was so scared I
tried to run away, 'cause I didn't know nothin' 'bout none of them. And
I thought dat white man what brought me down here ought to have saved me
from all dis. I just thought a white man was my God, I didn't know no
better.


"Well, when my folks finally stopped rejoicing, my mother only had two
chickens. She killed and cooked dem for me. My father and brothers would
go to work every day and leave me at home with my mother for over a
year. They would not trust me to work, feared I would run off 'cause I
didn't no nothin' 'bout them. Hadn't even heard of a mother and father.
My brother and father would work all day and only get one peck of corn
or one pound of meat or one quart of molasses for a whole day's work
from sun up till sun down. We had to grind dat corn for our flour, and
got biscuits once a year at Christmas and den only one biscuit apiece.


"After a little better'n a year after I come, the white man told my
father to bring his family and move from Greenhill, Virginia to Patrick
County, Virginia to his big farm, and farm dere for him and he would
give him one half of all he raised for his share. We went, and did we
raise a big crop. He kep' his word all right and we stayed dere till de
white man died five years later. Den we went to another farm. We had
cleared enough in the five years to buy us a fine pair of oxen and had
money besides. So we went to another farm and went to work giving the
owner of the farm one third of the crop and kep' two thirds ourselves.
We stayed there two years. Then father sold de oxen and went to
Sweetville, Virginia and bought $200 worth of land and stayed about five
years. We made our crop with a hoe and made good. Den I left home and
run about all over, learned how to play a violin and made my livin' with
it for a long time.


"I quit dat and railroaded about eight years working on sections and new
grading. Den went to Decatur, Alabama and worked with a land company
putting down pipings about three months. I quit dat and married Anna
Johnson and come to Giles County, Tennessee. We had one son.


"I came to St. Louis from Tennessee more dan forty years ago. I got work
right away at Cycle & Harris Steel Plant on 18th Street and worked dere
about six months, when I got scalded almost to death on the job. I got a
new nose and a new ear from dat accident. All de flesh of my right arm
was off to de bone. I was in de hospital eight months from it and I got
$500 out of de damage suit. I bought me a horse and wagon out of it and
done light hauling, and moved out here in Lincoln Terrace and been out
here ever since.


"I landscaped out here for sixteen years until I was disabled to work
hard any more. I got a garden but I can't make any money from it, 'cause
all de other folks out here got gardens too. I am a deacon in Mt. Zion
Baptist Church right here at de corner. Rev. Thomas is my pastor.


"I only went to school three days in my whole life but a colored friend
taught me how to spell out of a blue back spelling book. His name was
Charlie Snowball. I was learning fine until I got burned. Den my eye
sight was poor for a long time, but I see now very good. I only need
glasses for to read what little I can read. I can't write at all. My
grandfather was 135 years old when he died, and my father lived to be
135.


"De white people in Missouri sure have been mighty good to me since I
been here. I have as nice clothes as any man in St. Louis, good clothes
what I mean. All been given' to me by white people able to give
somethin'. I have not had to buy a hat, shoes or suit of clothes for
over twenty-five years, and got far more good clothes dan I can ever
wear out till my dying day. I think these 20th century white folks dat
have principle are trying to make amends to Negroes to make up for the
meanness their foreparents done to us, so I try to forgive 'em all in my
heart for the sake of a few good ones now. I've buried two wifes from
dis very house. I am now living with my third wife and she is a mighty
fine woman. We have been together about sixteen years."

    _Bred Slaves Like Stock_


Hannah Jones was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, August 3, about 1850,
the daughter of Lottie Oil and Noah Thompson. Her story follows:


"The niggers had three or four wifes before de war, as many as dey could
bear chillun by. But after de war dey had to take one woman and marry
her. My mother had three chillun by him and de odder wifes had three and
four chillun too. Old man, Ben Oil raised my mother. He was an old
bachelor but his brothers were all married.


"Ben Oil had 100 niggers. He just raised niggers on his plantation. His
brother-in-law, John Cross raised niggers, too. He had 125 niggers. He
had a nigger farm. His other brother-in-law we call old man English, had
100 niggers. Dey all jes' had nothin' else but niggers. Before de war
broke out, Tom Oil and John Oil come up dah and taken all us niggers but
eight and eight acres of land he left for Ben Oil's housekeeper. Old
Marse Ben died and after dat Tom carried us all back down der to New
Orleans wid him and opened up a nigger pen. Dat's a place like a stock
yard where dey auction us off. De old ones was de ones dey was anxious
to get shet of. We only know our ages by known' we is born in corn
plantin' and cotton pickin' time. We never even knowed de days of de
week.


"I had three aunts to die in all dat huddle of niggers. De doctors make
us go walking every day 'cause dat was de only exercise we git. One of
dem aunts dropped dead on de street while walking. De other two died in
de slave pen. My grandmother was a fine seamstress. She sewed all de
sewing for de white folks. Three days after her first baby was born dey
made her git up and make twelve stiff-front, tucked white shirts for her
old mistress' boy who be goin' off to college and she was so sick and
weak, some of de stitches was crooked. Old Miss ordered de overseer to
take her out and beat her 'bout it. Before he did de doctor looked at
her and said 'tain't no use beatin' her she won't do you no more good.
She's stone blind, but she can have chillun right on. So dey kept her
for dat and she bore twelve more head of chillun after dat.


"My mother was black as a crow and her hair was so long she could sit on
it. Dey brought a huddle of niggers over amongst de Indians from all
over de south and Maryland and intermarried 'em wid dere own sisters,
brothers, cousins, nieces and de like. De niggers didn't know for years
dey was any kin. When dey want to raise certain kind a breed of chillun
or certain color, dey just mixed us up to suit dat taste, and tell de
nigger dis is your wife or dis is your husband and dey take each other
and not know no better and raise big families to de white folks liking.


"I never can forget one Sunday morning de rebels come into Cape
Girardeau. De old Miss what raised me had just killed two hogs and put
'em in de smoke house. I got up bright and early dat Sunday morning. I
looked out toward de smoke house and seed two white men out dere dressed
in blue clothes and dey just went in Old Miss' smoke house and help dem
selves. I run right fast and told old Miss what was going on out der in
her smoke house. But dere wasn't no men folks around so we couldn't help
ourselves. Dey told us dey was 300 strong and just den some others come
over de hill and told 'em come on, hurry up so dey climbed de hill in a
hurry leaving dere. They had three gun boats and dey turned one of dem
things loose up der as dey was goin' and Lawd child dat thing destroyed
property for miles around.


"Some of dem rebels had ball bats, some had sticks, some riding and some
walking. Dey killed three of us niggers in our camp dat morning. All de
nigger men been taken away just leaving us nigger women and chillun. Dey
burned down frame and log huts just de same. My mother lived to be 115
years old, two uncles lived to be 100, one sister over 60. I use glasses
when I read but am blind in one eye. My husband has been dead 37 years.
He was an old soldier so Uncle Sam gives me a pension.


"I had 15 head of chillun. I have now seven grandchillun and four great
grandchillun. I has been in St. Louis 17 years and lives with my
daughter Nancy McDonald, 2804 Dayton Street."

    *Interview with Emma Knight,*
    *Hannibal, Missouri.*


    _Emma Was Really Rough_


Emma Knight, living at 924 North Street, Hannibal, Missouri, was born in
slavery on the farm of Will and Emily Ely, near Florida, Monroe County.
The following is her story as she told it:


"We lived on a Creek near Florida. We belonged to Will Ely. He had only
five slaves, my father and mother and three of us girls. I was only
eight or nine years old. De Elys had eight children. Dere was Paula,
Ann, Sarah, Becky, Emily, Lizzie, Will, Ike, and Frank. Lizzie was de
oldest girl and I was to belong to her when she was married.


"De master of de house was better to us dan de mistress. We didn't have
to work none too hard, 'cause we was so young, I guess. We cut weeds
along de fences, pulled weeds in de garden and helped de mistress with
de hoeing. We had to feed de stock, sheep, hogs, and calves, because de
young masters wouldn't do de work. In de evenings we was made to knit a
finger width and if we missed a stitch would have to pull all the yarn
out and do it over. De master's girls learned us to read and write. We
didn't have hardly no clothes and most of de time dey was just rags. We
went barefoot until it got real cold. Our feet would crack open from de
cold and bleed. We would sit down and bawl and cry because it hurt so.
Mother made moccasins for our feet from old pants. Late in de fall
master would go to Hannibal or Palmyra and bring us shoes and clothes.
We got dem things only once a year. I had to wear de young master's
overalls for underwear and linseys for a dress.


"My father was took away. My mother said he was put on a block and sold
'cause de master wanted money to buy something for de house. My mother
told me she come from Virginia or down south some place. Dey brought her
in a box car with lots of other colored people. Dere was several cars
full, with men in one car, women in another, and de younger ones in
another, and de babies in another with some of the women to care for
dem. Dey brought dem to Palmyra and sold dem. Master Ely bought my
mother. I don't know where my father come from.


"Mistress always told us dat if we run away somebody would catch us and
kill us. We was always scared when somebody strange come. De first we
knew dere was a war was when some soldiers come through. We was sure
scared den. Once a man come and we thought he was a patroller but he
asked for something to eat. Mother took him to de mistress. She gave him
something to eat wrapped in a paper and told him to get off de place.


"Some Union soldiers come and told us that we was free like dey was and
told us not to be afraid, dey wouldn't hurt us. Dey told us de war was
over. De master told mother not to go away, dat if she stayed a while he
would give her a couple hundred dollars. We stayed a while but she never
got no money.


"We come to Hannibal in an ox wagon. We put up at de barracks and den
mother went to live with Hiram Titchner. He lived right where de
postoffice is now. I hired out to Mrs. James across de street for my
clothes and schooling. Mrs. James had two girls. One of dem learned me
not to be such a tomboy and not to be so rough. I tell you I was a bad
girl when I was young. I could climb every tree on de master's farm and
my clothes was always in rags from being so rough. My mother used to
whip me most every day with a broom stick and even hit me with chairs. I
guess I was bad. If I had a dollar for every broom handle that was laid
across my back I would have lots of money. I tell you we was raised
plenty tuff dem days.


"De young folks can't stand such raising dese days. Dey just couldn't go
through what we was through. The young folks now just couldn't do it at
all. We never was 'lowed on the street after nine o'clock. We sure run
for home when the church bell done rung on de hill at nine o'clock.
Now-a-days de young folks stays out half de night and dey steal and even
kill each other over triflin' things. I know it 'cause I see them do
dese things. I 'spose dere parents are a lot to blame.


"I was married when I was young, less dan twenty I reckon. I had one
girl but she is dead now. Her boy lives with me. I gets a pension, seven
dollars a month, for about a year now. This little old shack belongs to
me. I go to de Baptist Church over on Center Street when ever I can. We
used to go to church on de corner 'cross from de postoffice. Dere is a
big store dere now."
